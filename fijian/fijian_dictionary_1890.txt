PREFACE. 



As the aspect of this little work, on a slight inspection, will 
appear different from that of books of this kind generally, in 
other languages, it appears necessary to say a few words in 
explanation and defence of the plan adopted. The reason for 
its apparent singularity is, that the structure of the language 
seemed to require it. We can find nothing in ancient or modern 
languages analogous to the different forms assumed by the Fijian 
verb. We refer more especially to the different terminations ; for 
in the reduplicated, and partly reduplicated, forms, and those 
which express causation, and intensity, we have something very 
similar in the Hebrew. 

The variable termination has been separated from the simple 
form of the verb, to show that it is only a variable termination, 
and that the word may be used without it, (only in a different 
sense,) and that the verb frequently rejects one termination, and 
takes another. Another, and not the least, advantage of thus 
separating the termination by a hyphen is, that the different 
terminations which a verb can assume can be shown witlioat 
repeating the whole word, which saves labour in writing and 
printing : e. g. basu-ka, or -laka ; dara-va, or -ma, or -maka : 
this saves the repetition of dara, the simple form, three times. 
The different senses of the different terminations, or when a verb 
should be used in its simple form, or when with any of its termi- 
nations, is a somewhat difficult but very important subject, and 
is fully treated of in the Grammar ; though it is not entirely 
untouched here. The same remark holds good respecting tie 
reduplicated and partly reduplicated forms. Those given are 
rather given as spec mens than as designing to include the whole. 
So of the reciprocal form of the verb, beginning with vei, those 
given must not be supposed to include the whole, or a tenth part 
of this class of verbs which the language contains, but are rather 
inserted as a few examples of the whole class. The rule by which 
this class is formed is easy, and almost without exception, so that 
it is quite unnecessary to insert any more than a few examples. 
The student can form them at pleasure. The termination sepa- 
rated by the hyphen invariably gives the verb a transitive sense. 
But when a word does not alter its simple form on becoming tran- 
sitive, (which, however, is never the case unless the simple form 
terminates in a,) yet it invariably removes its accent to the last 
syllable. This has been shown in the following manner : vola, 
V. intr. ; vola, tr. ; tara. v. intr. ; tara, tr. 

The Fijian accentuation is simple and easy. As in the Hebrew, 

a 2 



4 PKEFACE. 

the accent is invariably on the ultimate, or penultimate syllable, 
but in nine cases out of ten it is on the penultimate. Hence, 
when a verb takes a transitive termination, it removes its accent. 
If the termination consists of one syllable, the accent will be 
removed one syllable nearer the end of the word ; if two, it will 
be removed two syllables ; as, basu, basuka, basuraka, to break. 
The same holds good when expletive terminations are added, as 
vola, volaya ; qalo, qalori ; sabe, sabea. But when any word is 
entirely reduplicated, the word will have two accents, as caka, 
cakacaka, to work ; sega, segasega. But when a word is only 
partially reduplicated, it follows the general rule, viz., has the 
accent on the penultimate : as lomana, loloma ; levu, lelevu ; 
vinaka, vakavinavinaka. The preceding rules, (for such they 
may be called,) appear to be without exception, and may always 
be followed. 

When the accent is on the last syllable, it has been noted thus : 
kila ; and all words not so marked are to be considered as accent- 
ing the penultimate. Also all vowels that have a more than 
ordinarily long sound are shown in the usual way, as lamawa. 
For it must not be supposed, because the accent is on the 
last syllable but one, that that is the only long syllable. On the 
contrary, the accent generally shortens the vowel, except when 
on the last syllable, as in kila. 

On account of this tendency of the language to a penultimate 
accent, the natives accent most of those trisyllabic and poly- 
syllabic proper names which are introduced differently from us ; 
and we must either accent introduced names differently in native 
from what we do in English, or do violence to a prominent fea- 
ture in the language : as, Josefa, not Josefa ; Wiliami, not 
Wiliami. 

The above simple rules being attended to, this book will answer 
all the purposes of a pronouncing dictionary. 

The ,-na separated by a comma and hyphen from some nouns, 
is only designed to show that those nouns take the poss. pronouns 
postfixed ; as, ulu,-na, his head, instead of nona ulu. The ,-na 
is used in preference to any other pronominal postfix, because it 
more commonly occurs. Some few nouns which can take the 
pronoun either postfixed or prefixed are noted thus : vicovico,-na, 
or nona vicovico. 

The asterisk is designed to show that the word which it pre- 
cedes is not properly a word of the Bau dialect, (which dialect we 
have generally adopted,) but many words thus noted are more 
extensively known and used throughout the group than the cor- 
responding Bau word ; which is generally inserted after it. 

Many classes of words have been wholly or mostly omitted. 
Amongst these we may notice : 

I. Many forms of the verb : as — 

(1.) Verbs commencing with the prefixes dau, vaka, and vei. 
They must be sought for by rejecting these prefixes. 

(2.) The reduplicated forms of the verb are generally omitted, 



PREFACE. 5 

and the verb is to be sought for under its simple form. Verbs, 
however, whose simple form is but partly reduplicated will fre- 
quently be found in their proper alphabetical order, and the 
.simple" form, or root, referred to for the sense. 

Note. — When a transitive verb is reduplicated, the simple 
form, or root only, undergoes reduplication : as cakacakava, 
doladolava : not cakavacakava. But when two verbs are com- 
pounded into one, we not unfrequently find both forms, as me 
selevadrutia as well as me seledrutia. But generally the latter 
only of the two verbs takes the transitive form, as in the last 
example. 

(3.) Some of these compound words will be found inserted in 
their alphabetical order. The natives frequently, by compound- 
ing verbs, express themselves with astonishing clearness, brevity, 
and force ; which cannot be imitated in English. We have gene- 
rally to express the sense by two verbs with a preposition or 
conjunction between them, or by a verb and an adverb ; as, sa 
qasilutu ki nai keli na gone, the child has crept and fallen into 
the pit ; me varomusuka, to saw in pieces, or asunder ; me tamu- 
suka, to chop asunder ; me vosacudrucudruya, to speak angrily ; 
me sovabiuta, to pour out and throw away ; me tayabiuta, to 
chop off and throw away : but the English does not well express 
the native idea ; me mokuta vakamatea, to smite one and kill 
him by so doing ; mokuta vakabula, to smite one but not kill 
him, — lit. to smite him save him alive. The passives of these 
are mokumate, mokubula. These seem to have the same claim 
to be written as one word as tamusuka ; but perhaps they ought 
all to be written separately. 

II. Most adjectives admit of a partial or entire reduplication. 
Some few of these will be found inserted, but many more will be 
heard used by the natives. Those given will be sufficient to give 
the general aspect of this class of adjectives. In many com- 
pound adjectives, either the simple words of which they are com- 
posed may both be reduplicated, or parts of both ; as of ba and 
saga, we have basaga, which by reduplication may become either 
basabasaga, or babasagasaga, full of branches ; balavu, babalavu, 
or balabalavu, or bababalavu, long ; kavoro, kakavorovoro, 
broken in many pieces. This reduplication expresses either plu- 
rality or intensity. 

III. "Verbal nouns, or nouns of action, which generally have 
precisely the same form as the indef. tr., or simple form of the 
verb, are omitted. For one class of verbal nouns omitted, see 
under — Ai. 

IV. The active intransitive form of the verbs, which are gene- 
rally nothing more than a reduplication of the simple form of 
the verb, as, cakacaka, solosolo, are generally unnoticed. See 
this subject explained in the Grammar. 

We have aimed at giving the senses and terminations of the 
words as used in the Bau dialect. Many of the words are used in 



6 PREFACE. 

different senses, and with different terminations, in other dialects, 
which have in some instances only been noticed. 

As utility, rather than correctness of form, has been aimed at, 
sometimes words are designedly not arranged in alphabetical 
order, to show their relation to each other. For the same end 
will be found numerous references to synonymous, or nearly- 
synonymous words, and the simple words from which compound 
words are formed. 

Native definitions are frequently given for various reasons. 
They will show the learner the manner in which natives define 
words. And it will be seen that they generally treat all parts 
of speech as nouns. They may also be regarded as pure native 
modes of speaking. They also express the native idea better than 
English words can. 

It must be particularly observed, that the terminations have 
not been allowed in any measure to influence the alphabetical 
arrangement, as this would frequently cause great and quite un- 
necessary confusion, separating words far apart which would 
naturally come together : as Bulu-ta will be found before bulu- 
bulu, and bulukovu. 

If Grod be glorified in the additional facilities which this book 
may render for the instruction of the natives, the end for which 
it is written will be fully answered. 

D. H. 

Nandy, Fiji, July 27th, 1850. 

Bromley, Kent, 1872.— J. C. 



Besides the usual abbreviations of the parts of speech, the 
following are frequently used : — 



E- the Bau dialect. 
dia. dialect, dialects, 
def. tr. definite transitive, 
indef. tr. indefinite transitive. 
a intr. active intransitive. 



n. intr. neuter intransitive, 
intr. intransitive, intransitives. 
lit. literal, literally, 
opp opposite, opposites. 
syn. synonymous. 



The long a is indicated by a dash over it, as qaqa ; other long 
vowels are distinguished by the grave accent, and the short 
vowels are sometimes shown by the acute accent. The short 
vowels have only been noted when it was necessary to distinguish 
one word from another, similarly spelt, but having a different 
sense ; as qaqa, qaqa. 



FIJIAN AND ENGLISH 
DICTIONABY. 



A, an article ; it is used chiefly, 
1. Before common nouns ; as, a 
tamata, a man. 2. Before pos- 
sessive pronouns ; as, a noda, 
ours. 3. Before verbs when they 
have a participial sense ; as, o 
ira na soko, those sailing ; here, 
however, tamata may he under- 
stood, as, o ira na tamata sa soko. 
4. It is used before particles 
which indicate the poss. case ; 
as, a nei, a mei, a kei : see nei, 
mei, kei. From the above va- 
rious uses of it, a is evidently 
an indefinite article. See Ai. 

A, or Ka, conj. and or but. 

A, or Ka, a sign of the past tense. 
See Acts iv. 2. A only is used 
after a pron. : as, au a (not ka) 
lako, I went. 

A, strongly accented, is used be- 
fore certain words of respect, &c. 
as, a ! muduo ! a ! io dua! a ! maca ! 

Adi, a common prenomen to ladies' 
names ; same as madam, miss, 
lady. It is the same as ratu, 
sir, or Mr. before men's names. 

Ai,the same article as a, only used 
before nouns which are preceded 
by i, whether an art. or other 
word precedes ; as, ai vaiu, sai 
valu,eraivalu. These nouns are 
indicated in this dictionary by 
this form of the article being 
prefixed to them : e. g. see sele. 
The following rules, however, 
may be useful: — 1. Nouns de- 
rived from active verbs which 
express the instruments by 
which a work is effected, are 



preceded by i, as, ai koti, a pair 
of scissors; ai sele, a knife. See 
also, ai tukituki, ai vutu, ai seru. 
2. Nouns derived from neuter 
verbs, which express the place 
or position in which the state of 
being occurs which is expressed 
in the neuter verb, as, ai tutu, a 
place to stand in or on ; ai koto- 
koto, a place to lie on ; ai moce- 
moce, a place to sleep on. 3. 
Verbal nouns which express the 
mode of an action ; as, au sa sega 
ni kila nai cakacaka ni ka o qo, I 
do not know the working of this 
thing : — i.e., I do not know how 
to do it ; au sa sega ni kila na 
kenai doladola, I do not know 
how to open it ; au sa vinakata 
na kenai kanakana, I like the 
eat of it ; au sa sega ni kila na 
kenai lakolako, I do not know 
the go of it. This class of verbal 
nouns is here noticed once for 
all ; they will not be found in 
this work. Almost all verbs may 
become nouns of this class. To 
the three rules above there are 
very few exceptions. Others 
might be added, but are more 
exceptionable. 
Ai cavai, see under Cava. 
Aiti, an interj. of disapprobation. 
Alewa,orYalewa,n.afemale; used 
also adjectively to distinguish 
the sex ; as, a toa alewa, a hen. 
Vakaalewa, or Vakayalewa, a. 
womanlike , feminine : of, or per- 
taining to, women : ad. in a wo- 
manlike manner.

DAT— DAU. 



smaller number of person?. See 

more fully under Da. 
Datuvu, n. a coward : a. cowardly. 
Dau, a very important particle. 

It precedes and (like adverbs) 

qualifies adjectives and verbs. 

1. "With, adjectives it has an 
intensive, or frequentative sense ; as, 
a tamata loloma, a loving man ; a 
tamata dauloloma, a very loving 
man. Sa dauvinaka, it is generally 
or customarily good. 

2. With verbs it has the sense of 
intensify, frequency, or continuance, 
but more commonly of the two 
latter. With very many verbs it 
cannot have an intensive, but only 
a frequentative sense, as in dautiko, 
dautu, daukoto, daulutu, daumoce, 
dausoko. In such cases its sense 
may be rendered by such adverbs 
as generally, frequently, habitually, 
commonly, always. With many 
verbs it may have either an inten- 
sive or frequentative sense ; as, a 
tamata daulako, may mean a man 
who goes swiftly, or a man always 
going, but it would more generally 
have the latter signification : a 
tamata daucakacaka, a man always 
at work ; rarely if ever a man avIio 
works hard, or does work quickly ; 
this would be expressed by a 
tamata gumatua e na cakacaka. It 
precedes verbs of all kinds, tran- 
sitive, or intransitive, causative, re- 
ciprocal, and reciprocal-causative, 
but has substantially the same 
sense in all cases ; as, me daukaci, 
to call frequently ; me daucakava, 
to do a thing frequently ; me dau- 
vakabula, to save, spare, or cause to 
live frequently ; me dauveiraici, to 
see each other frequently; me 
dauveivakacudrui, frequently to 
cause each other to be angry. Hence, 
when united with a verb, the word 
will express both the agent, or 
subject, and the action ; as, a dau- 
butako, one who frequently steals, 
a thief; a dauvere, one who fre- 
quently tempts, a tempter ; a dau- 
veivakarusai, one who frequently 
•destroys, a destroyer : these are pro- 



perly speaking adjectives used for 
nouns, and their signification is 
neither increased nor diminished 
when the understood noun is 
expressed ; as, a tamata daubutako, 
a tamata dauvere, a tamata dau- 
veivakarnsai, are the same as the 
above. None of the adjectives of 
this class are in this dictionary. 

3. Dau frequently precedes com- 
mon nouns, and adjective pro- 
nouns, but docs not qualify them 
but some verb understood; as, era 
dau tamata vinaka, they are mostly 
good men. It is evident that mostly 
qualifies the verb are, etc., not the 
noun men : sa dau nodai valavala, 
it is commonly our practice ; com- 
monly docs not qualify our but is. 
For this reason it ought not to be 
united with nouns and adjective 
pronouns. 

Dau is sometimes reduplicated; 
as, Sa daudau nonai mocemoce tu, 
it is commonly his sleeping place. 
Dau, n. an adept ; practitioner ; 
professor of a thing ; as dau ni 
vucu, a dau ni kesa, a dau ni

E 



E, the words beginning with E are 
mostly -words compounded with 
the preposition E, in, and some 
other word, as will be seen below. 

E, an indefinite sign of tense, some- 
times used alone in the same 
sense as sa; as,e vinaka, or sa vina- 
ka; sometimes it is used with sa; 
as, e sa vinaka, generally at the be- 
ginning of a sentence ; sometimes 
it is used with the sign of the future 
na ; as, ena ; generally also at the 
beginning of a sentence, probably 
for the sake of euphony. It may 
frequently be interchanged w r ith 
sa, but in many instances it can- 
not; as it is never used imme- 
diately after a per. pronoun ; as, 
au sa lako, ko sa raica, etc., not 
au e lako, ko e raica. It is not 
used before the per. pronouns in 
many cases ; as, sai au, sai iko, 
not ei au, ei iko. It is united 
with the future sign na to distin- 
guish from e na the pre. and art. 



40 



E— EWA. 



E, a particle (a sort of article) which 
precedes numerals; as, c dua, e 
rua, e tolu, etc., and some few 
other words expressive of num- 
ber ; as, e so, e vuqa, e vica. It 
precedes le and lewe when they 
precede numerals ; as, a tamata e 
le dua. Like the article a, it is 
omitted when the particle sa pre- 
cedes ; as, sa tamata, not sa a ta- 
mata ; sa dun, sa le rua. But that 
it is not merely a substitute for sa 
is evident, as it is used in cases in 
which sa cannot ; as, keitou sa sega 
ni vakacacana e dua, keitou sa sega 
ni vakacala e dua, keitou sa sega 
ni lawakitaka c dua. Here sa is 
quite inadmissible. It approaches 
more nearly to the sense of the 
article na than to the particle 
sa. 

E, prep, in, is generally followed by 
the art. na, except when used be- 
fore poss. pro. or nouns with the 
poss. pro. postfixed, and then it 
may be used with or without the 
art. ; as, e ligaqu, or e na ligaqu ; 
enona, or e na nona. The prep. 
c with many nouns makes an ad- 
verbial phrase : as, e matana, or e 
na matana, before; e dakuna, 
behind ; e rukuna, or e na rukuna, 
under. 

E, or I, is used before the voc. case 
of nouns, but only seldom, except 
before proper names, and then it 
may be omitted ; as, I Joni, or 
Joni only. 

Ecake, prep, above. E and Cake. 

Ece, v. n. intr. to sit on one's heels 
Vakaviti ; also to move about in 
that posture ; to be or move 
closely to the ground ; as, sa ece 
na viia ni niu, the nut fruits very 
near the ground, while ^ery short. 
Sa ece ca, to be restless to obtain 

a thing. 

Eda, per. pro. we, including the 
person addressed, and implies 
many. Eda, Edam, Edatou, Era, 
Erau, Eratou, are used as nom. 
cases before verbs ; they are never 
used as obj. cases after verbs and 
prep. 



Edaidai, ad. now, to-day, recently,

sently, just now.

standing or lying on the outside 
when several are together. It 
differs from e Sauka,-na, as 
this implies outside of a thing, 
as of a cup, or outside of a fence, 
etc. 

Eso, (e s6) a. pro. some. Yakaso, 
ad. partly, some only. 

Evei, ad. where ? of place : also

wash with. The same difference 
holds in the other pro. as noda, 
keda ; nodra, kedra ; nomu, 
kemu ; neitou, keitou ; nodrnu, ke- 
drau ; etc. When the possessive 
pronouns commence with Kc there 
is not generally proper possession.

kei.

N 



Na and Nai, the same art. as A 
and Ai, which sec. The chief 
difference is, that a and ai arc 
generally used at the beginning of 



a sentence, and na and nai in the 
middle. Hence it is always used 
after the tr. form of verbs and 
prepositions, as lomana na tama- 
ta, ki na tamata, not lomana a, 
and ki a. 
Na, the sign of the future tense, as 
Au na lako, I shall or will go. It 
is also used for the present, to 
express probability, possibility, or 
uncertainty ; as, sa na dina ga, it 
is likely to be true ; sa na nona 
beka ga, it may be his. It thus 
frequently answers to our poten- 
tial and subjunctive moods. 
The following critical remark on 
Na, written by a native 07i reading 
it in the following lines, are worthy 
of notice. 

cei na lako cake ki na uluniva- 
nua nei Jiova? Sc ko cei tu e nona 
tikina tabu? Ps. xxiv. 3. 

Oi keimami na kai Yiti, c cala ni 
vosataki e na neimami vanua, cei 
na lako cake : e dodonu ga vei kei- 
mami, cei ena lako cake, kevaka 
e tarogi na kana ena lako, kei na se 
ko cei ka lako cake, kevaka e vaka- 
wai na kana e lako. It is not cor- 
rect with us to say, O cei na lako 
cake ; it is correct with us to say, O 
cei ena lako cake, when it is asked 
who is the person who will go, or 
who goes when a thing is declared 
(or inquired about) . 

From the above it appears incor- 
rect to use na as the future sign 
after ko cei. The phraseology is 
singular, though I believe correct. 
Na and Nana, a word used by chil- 
dren when addressing their mo- 
ther, instead of the name. Nau 
is also so used : same as Ta and 
Tata for father. Much the same 
as mama and papa in English.

Nequ, poss. pro. same as Noqu. 
Neu, an inter] . used only by women. 
Ni, per. pro. a contraction of i 

Kemuni, which seo. 
Ni, prep, of sign of the poss. case j 
of common nouns, and proper | 
names of places, and of poss. 
pro. ; as, a dra ni kau, a alewa 
ni Bau, a kau ni nona vale. 
Before proper names oi persons 
it becomes i, as a vuaka i Tui- 
kilakila. It is also used to 
express tho genitive of the object, 
as it is called. The following 
examples will illustrate it ; a 
kato ni qele, a basket for earth ; 
a kato qele, a basket of earth : 
a su ni ika, a basket for fish ; a 



su ika, a basket of fish : a tavaya 
ni waiwai, a bottle for oil ; a 
tavaya waiwai, a bottle of oil : 
a liga ni bokola implies a hand 
for, or to make, bokolas, as well 
as for the hand of the bokola. 
Ni, a particle which indicates 
several kinds of connections be- 
tween the members of sentences; 
as when, since, because : hence 
it accompanies words of time, as. 
whilst ; as, ni siga, by day, or 
whilst it is day ; ni bogi, by 
i night ; ninaica, when. 

Ni (when) is used before a verb 
when it follows another verb, and 
answers to our infinitive mood, or 
participle. But with the follow- 
ing restrictions. When simply 
an act is spoken of by the infinitive 
mood or participle, ni must boused. 
But when our in. mood signifies 
to the end that, ni cannot be used, 
but me, e. g. Au sa cata ni lako, 
or more fully, Au sa cata ni ka'u 
sa lako, lit. I hate (it) when I go, 
i. e. I hate to go, or I hate going. 
Au sa rere ni lako, I am afraid to 
go, or I fear going. Au sa kakua 
ni soko, au sa bese ni talai, au sa 
bera ni kitaka, au sa kusaraw r a ni 
ka'u sa kauta, au sa dredre ni 
vakabauta, au sa gu ni lako, etc. 

The reason why the negatives ka- 
kua and scga take the ni after them 
is, that they are verbs. See under 
Sega. The verb to be is sometimes 
understood ; as, sa scga ni nomu, 
it is not yours — literally it is 
lost (or fled, sega) when it is 
yours. 

It may be omitted, and the arti- 
cle used instead, but w r ith an 
important difference in sense ; as, 
sa sega ni nona, it is not his, viz. a 
thing spoken of before ; but sa 
sega na nona is, he has none : me 
kakua ni lako, prohibits a certain 
person, or persons from going ; but 
me kakua na lako, prohibits any 
one going. The same difference 
exists between, sa sega ni lako, 
and sa scga na lako.

T 

T has not precisely the same 
sound in Fijian as in English. 
The tongue touches the teeth in 
pronouncing the Fijian t. 
Ta, like Ka, is prefixed to the intr. 
or pass, forms of many verbs, 
and changes them into adj. or 
pass. part, as, Tadola, open, 
from Dola-va, to open. "Words 
thus formed differ from adj. 
and pass, verbs generally in 
this respect, that they imply 
that tho thing has become so of 
itself. But it appears to be used 
also when they do not toish to 
mention^ovyvhen they do not know 
the agent by whom the thing 
has come into the state expressed 
by this form of the verb, or by 
this kind of adj. They might 
be called impersonal passive

tr. termination ? 
Ta, and Tata, v. intr. to chop, or 
cut with an axe. Ta, pass, not 



Tai. See Tava. Tata differs a 
little from Ta: it is generally 
applied to chopping a thing 
lightly, so as to bring it to a 
smooth surface. Ta is com- 
pounded with several other 
words, which have the sense of 
cutting, as tamusu-ka, tase-a, 
takoso-va. 
Sa ta qa, wounded, all but 

dead. 

Ta-ya, v. def. tr. of tho above,

A dromu ni nonai vaci, the lower

to the Tongan Behe, which 
signifies as, and to say ; as, sa 
vaka ko tui Viti me'u lake ; tui 
Viti says, or intimates that I 
am to go : as, also in the form 
of vakaio, to say io : vakadina- 
dina, to say dina ; vakavina- 
vinaka, to say vinaka ; vakabeka- 
beka, to say beka. 

Vaka, a particle much used in com- 
position, and generally implies 
similitude or causation. 

1. It changes nouns into adjectives ,~ 
as, vuravura, the world ; vaka- 
vuravura, like, or after the man- 
ner of the world : worldly, or per- 
taining to the world : vakatamata, 
after the manner of men, per- 
taining to men : vakagonegone, 
like a child, childish. 

2. It changes adjectives into ad. 
as, ca, bad ; vakaca, lit. like bad ; 
badly : vinaka, good ; vakavinaka, 
well : levu, great ; vakalevu, 
greatly. With numeral adjectives^ 
it implies so many times as the num- 
eral expresses ; as vakadua, once ; 
vakarua, twice ; vakava, , four 
times ; vakatini, ten times. 

3. With nouns it also implies 
the possessio?i of the thing which 
the noun expresses, as drau, a 
leaf ; vakadrau, having leaves ; 
vale, a house; vakavale, having a 
house : were, a garden : vakawere. 
having a garden : a vanua Vaka- 
bau, a land belonging to Bau ; a 
vanua Vakabati, a land belonging 
to the Bati. In this sense also it 
changes nouns into adjectives. 

In the following, and probably 
other instances, in nouns of 
relationship, it unaccountably 
changes the final vowel, as vei does 
— vakatamani, vakatinani, vaka- 
wekani. 

4. Analogously to the above 
sense vaka changes nouns into 
verbs which siguify to cause a 
thing to have posscssio7i of what is 
expressed in the noun, as vakadia- 
taka, put a handle into a thing, 
lit. put it in possession of a handle: 



YAK— VAK. 



145 



vakawaqataka, put a waqa, or 
cover on a thing, or put it in 
possession of a waqa. 

."). It also changes nouns into ad. 
by adding tho sense of wholly, 
entirely, or only, to that of the 
noun, as era sa lako vakatagano, 
men only are gone, no ■women ; 
or they are all men who are gone : 
era lako vakaalewa, they are gone 
females only : sa caka Vakanadi, 
it is done by all the Nan dy people; 
sa caka Vakabau, it is done by all 
tho Bau people. 

0. It changes adjectives into verbs, 
by causing the thing to be what is 
expressed by the adjective; as, 
ca, bad ; vakaeacana, or vakacaca- 
taka, cause to be bad, or cause it 
to be like ca, or bad; to spoil: 
balavu, long ; vakabalavutaka, 
cause to be long. 

7. It changes neuter intransitive 
verbs into active transitive ones, by 
making them causative ; as bula, 
to live ; vakabula, to cause to live ; 
to save : mate, to die ; vakamate-a, 
to cause to die ; to kill. 

S. It changes some two or three 
passive verbs in the same manner, 
viz. when the simple root is pas- 
sive ; as, me sucu, to be bom ; me 
vakasucu-ma, to cause to be born, 
or to bring forth ; rcgo, to be 
heard ; vakarogotaka, to cause to 
bo heard, i.e. to report. But these 
aro exceptions. See Grammar. 

9. It is sometimes, though sel- 
dom, prefixed to active tr. verbs, 
but never makes them causative, 
Vakncaka-va, Vakacola-ta, etc. 
Causatives of this kind are not 
used in Fijian. 

It is frequently difficult to de- 
fine the exact difference in sense 
between an a. tr. verb when used 
without the vaka, and the same 
verb with it, though it is evident 
that a difference generally, if not 
always, does exist; as, rai-ca, to 
look ; vakarai-ca, to look after, 
oversee : tala, to send; vakatala, 
to send off : vakavota, seems to 
signify to vota hastily. Its gene- 



ral aspect in such/cases appears 
to bo intensity. 

10. Vaka soems sometimes to 
have a difforent sense from any 
given above, when united to nume- 
rals ; as, a kai Butoni e vakarua ; 
o so sa kai Bau dina, e so sa lako 
ki Viwa. There are two divisions 
(tribes) of Butoni people ; somo 
true Bau natives, and some belong 
to Vewa. 

11. Neither does the use of 
vaka in such forms as the following 
appear to be included in any of the 
senses above given : sa raici vakau- 
kauwa na tiki ni yagona kecega, 
every part of his body appears 
strong, or he has a very muscular 
appearance ; sa raici vakatotolo na 
waqa, the canoe appears very 
swift ; sa raici vakaberabera na 
wapa, the canoe appears slow. If 
vakaukauwa, vakatotolo, and va- 
kaberabera "be adverbs here, they 
do not at all affect the verbs which 
precede them, as adverbs always do 
when they follow verbs. The sense 
is not seen strongly, seen swiftly, seen 
slowly. The sense seems to be, sa 
raici ni sa kaukauwa, sa raici ni 
sa totolo, sa raici ni sa berabera. 
Me kauta vakabalavu na kau o qo, 
take this tree long, or take it in 
its whole length ; taya vakabala- 
vu, cut it long. 

Remarks. — 1. Words commencing 
with vaka, must be sought for 
without it ; as, Vakaca will be 
found under Ca. 

2. Vaka is frequently contract- 
ed to Va. See Va. 

3. Vaka is occasionally redupli- 
cated ; as sa vakavakaga o qori. 
Vakaadua, and Vakaaduaga, a. all ; 

every. Kece, Kecega, syn. 
Vakaalewa, n. the wrought hole at 

the foot of the karikaritu into 

which the lower end of the ka-

nouns. 
Vei, ad. where? See Evei, Kivei,

Vei, a common prefix to different 

classes of words. 



1. Prefixed to nouns, it implies 
a plural, or collective number, as a 
vale, a house ; a veivale, the houses, 
generally. But it cannot be prefixed 
to all nouns in this way ; nouns to 
which it can be prefixed are gene- 
rally noticed in this Dictionary. 
See Were, Vale, etc. 

II. Prefixed to verbs, it implies : 
1 . Reciprocity, as veilomani, to love 
one another ; veicati, to hate one an- 
other. 2. With verbs of motion it 
frequently implies to go and come, 
or backwards and forward, which 
does not imply reciprocal motion, as 
veilakoyaki, veisokoyaki. 3. It 
sometimes implies an action at 
which more than one is present, 
though but one active, as veikeve, 
to nurse, where only the nurse is 
active, and the child passive. 4. 
It also sometimes implies the habit 
or custom of doing a thing, as 
sa veimoku, or dauveimoku ko ka. 
5. It very frequently changes 
verbs into nouns of action, as era 
kitaka na veibulu, lit. they are 
doing the burial ; era kitaka na 
veivakamatei, they are doing the 
(work of) slaughter. 

Remarks. — 1. When used with 
words which prefix Vaka, it pre- 
cedes the vaka, as in the last ex- 
ample. But when Dau is used, it 
precedes the Vei, as in dauveivaka- 
matei. 

2. Also whenever vei is prefixed 
to any class of verbs, those verbs 
always take their passive termina- 
tions ; as, lomani, beloved, veilo- 
mani : not veilomana. 

3. Words beginning with vei, 
must be sought under their simple 
form, as in Veisorovi, look for Soro- 
va. 

Vei is sometimes reduplicated, 
as a mate veiveitauvi, a very in- 
fectious disease; or rather, dis- 
ease with which many are af- 
flicted.

comes from Bulu, resides on the 
earth (vuravura), and causes the

ing all noise aud unnecessary labour, 
lest Ratumaibulu should be fright- 
ened, or offended, and leave the

would be unfruitful. It is tabu to 
soko, or ia nai valu, or teitci, in the 
vula i Ratu. See Tei bonobono,

tavuvuli, are the intr. forms of 
both the above senses, viz. to learn, 
and to teach; as, vakavuvuli, the 
n. intr. of vuli-ca ; hence, vakavu- 
vuli signifies to learn. From this 
sense we have the n. ai vakavuvuli, 
learning, instruction. 2. Vaka- 
vuvuli is the a. intr. of vakavuli-ca, 
to teach ; hence, vakavuvuli 
signifies to teach, or instruct. 
From this sense we have the n. ai 
vakavuvuli, a teacher or instruc- 
tor. The distinction between 
vakavuvuli as the n. intr. of vuli- 
ca, and as the a. intr. of vakavuli- 
ca, is necessary to be observed in 
order to understand this word.

ENGLISH AND FIJIAN. 



This second part is designed merely as an Index to the first. If used 
instead op the former, a veiy imperfect and uncertain knowledge of the 
language will be acquired. 

Perhaps there are but few words in any language precisely synony- 
mous, in all their bearings, with those of another language. Where the 
words are nearly synonymous, they are inserted without any restricting 
notice. But where the words are more remotely synonymous, they are 
generally prefaced by the word See, as after Broken. 

The article a, or na, is to be understood before all nouns when no article 
i> expressed. But nouns which take the article ai, or nai, before them, 
have it prefixed. See Abdomen, a kete,-na. 

The particle me is to be understood before the verbs ; as, To Abandon, 
me biuta.

FIJI (OR VITI) ISLANDS. 



THE NAMES OF THE ISLANDS OF THE FIJI GROUP, WITH' 

THEIR BEARINGS AND DISTANCES, CHIEFLY FROM 

BATJ AND LAKEMBA. 



Though these Islands have been discovered upwards of two hundred 
years, yet but little was generally known of their geography up to 1840, 
when they were surveyed by the American Exploring Expedition. Com- 
modore WirxES wrote an interesting account of them, from whose work 
we make several quotations. His book, published in America in five 
volumes, was abridged in England, and published in one volume by 
Whittaker and Co., London. 

Fiji is sometimes written and pronounced Viti, and at others Fiji. 
Both are correct : the former being its name in the leeward, and the latter 
in the windward, islands of the group. 

In the names of the islands we have followed the Fijian orthography, 
in which it must be observed, that a has the sound of a in father, — e the 
sound of a in fate, — i the sound of i in machine, — and u the sound of u in full. 
When a single consonant expresses the sound of two or three in English, 
we have given the English orthography also, retaining however the Fijian 
sounds of the vowels ; as, Bau, (Mbau). For names of the islands com- 
mencing with ih, mb, nd, ng, ngg, refer to c, b, d, g and q : as, for Thithia, 
refer to Cicia, c expressing the sound of th. Ai is sounded i. 

It is hoped that this list will correct and settle the orthography of the 
names of these islands, as they are spelt according to the native pro- 
nunciation. It may, it is believed, be safely appealed to in correcting, 
the orthographical errors of charts and books which refer to Fiji. 

The names are followed by their significations when known. 



Aiwa-levu, and Aiwa-lailai, two uninhabited islets, six miles south- 
east-half-east from Lakemba. They are very rocky, and "surrounded by 
an extensive reef, with the exception of a large opening on the north-east 
side, which affords an anchorage, exposed, however, to the north-east 
wind." 

Alewa-kalou, female god, the Round I. of the charts. "A rocky is- 
let twelve miles north-east of the Yasawas ; the passage into the group 
from the west and north-west takes its name from this island."

they discovered an opening through the reef, through which they 
passed, and anchored in one of the best harbours in the group. This

I have called Carr's Harbour. Its entrance is perhaps too narrow* for 
a ship to heat in, which the prevalence of easterly winds would gene- 
rally require to he done ; hut the channel to it is quite clear of 
patches, and the passage through the reef is a good one, though long. 
Within the reef there is a circular basin of large extent, in all parts 
of which a ship may select her berth with good bottom." 

Moala, a fine island about four miles wide, and eight long, west by 
south from Lakemba seventy-two miles distant, and east-south-east 
seventy-six miles distant from Bau. Towns, Navuthunimasi, Tha- 
kova, and some others. "It is a high volcanic island. There is an 
opening through the reef on the west side, that leads to an inferior 
harbour. The reef on the north side of Moala resembles that of 
Totoya, being a collection of sunken and detached patches. The reef 
on the north-east makes off to the distance of two miles and a half. 
After passing it, there is a deep indentation in the island, w'ith a 
broad passage through the reef, leading to a safe and very fine har- 
bour, and, what is unusual, the passage is sufficiently wide for a 
vessel to beat out. This, however, would seldom be necessary, as 
there are several passages through the reef to the westward, which 
are safe with a leading w r ind." 

Moce, (Mothe), an island twenty-five miles south-east by south from 
Lakemba, to which it is subject. Two towns. " It lies to the east of 
Komo ; it is one of the most picturesque in the group, with an undu- 
lating surface ; it is. about two miles in diameter, and surrounded by 
an extensive reef. Thero are three detached reefs to the eastward 
of it." 

Mocea, (Mothea), a long reef (the Eliza reef) which stretches off 
from Nairai. See Naikovu. 

Moturiki, an island four miles long and one wide, two miles south- 
west from Ovalau, and fourteen north-north-east from Bau. Subject 
to Bau. Vessels commonly anchor under it in passing out from Ban 
or Vewa. 

Munia, a small island four miles due east from Vanua Mbalavu, 
and fifty miles due north from Lakemba. Subject to Somosomo. 
"The highest peak called Ndelanikoro is one thousand and fifty-four 
feet above the sea. This peak is composed of volcanic masses, with 
high, craggy, and overhanging cliffs. The ascent is difficult, the path 
passing over steep hills, and along the edges of rocks, and in places 
so narrow that only one could pass at a time." 

Nabekavu, (Nambekavu), an island in the river Tuvu, about two 
miles from its mouth. The island is occupied by a town. The river 
empties itself into the sea on the north coast of Vanua Levu, at about 
twenty miles from its north-east point.

Naigani, (Naingani), a small, high island, ahout six miles north- 
west from Ovalau, and twenty-two miles north half east from 13au. 
Two towns. 
Naikasikasi. 

Naikovu, a rock)' islot on the Mothea reef. The iron-wood tree 
grows on it. The Kaikovu (Covu of U. S. Ex. Ex.) rock is a singular 
one. " It is inaccessible on three sides, of volcanic formation, and is 
enclosed by the Mocea (Mothea or Eliza) reef, which here spreads to 
the width of three miles, and extends four miles further south. The 
eastern side is an unbroken reef, but the western is somewhat irregu- 
lar and broken, with many openings for boats. Lieut. Underwood 
discovered a remarkable effect of local attraction here : so great as to 
cause a deviation of thirteen and a quarter points; Nairai, which 
was directly to the north, bearing, by compass, south-east by south 
one quarter south, while, what was quite remarkable, the same com- 
pass at tho foot of the rock, near the water, gave the bearing 
north." 

Nairai, an island fourteen miles due east from Mbatiki, and twelve 
miles north-east from Ngau, forty-eight miles east by north from Bau. 
Towns, Natauloa, chief town, Tovulailai, Lawaki, Kana, Waitonga. 
" Nairai is famous for its manufactories of mats, baskets, &c. The 
reef extends from the island four miles northward, and where it ends, 
turns for a short distance to the westward. It does not join tho 
island, but is connected with the Mocea (Mothea or Eliza) reef; and 
there is a good ship channel between it and the island, leading to tho 
large bay of Nakorobaba (Ivorombamba). On the eastern side of the 
bay there is good anchorage, in thirteen fathoms water. A broad 
passage leads from it to the soxithward, and then passes between 
Naikovu and Nairai to the south-west and passes through the reef. 
The only danger is a small coral patch, lying east-south-east, a mile 
from the south end of the island, and a mile north of Naikovu (Covu) 
Rock." 
Naisausau, a small island at the back of Vanua Levu. 
Naisonisoni, a lofty point just separated at high water from Vanua 
Levu. It is commonly, but erroneously, called Kumbulau, or Navatu 
Point. Navatu lies on a small and low island nearly behind it, and 
Kubulau Point is four miles off towards Nasavusavu Bay. There is 
good anchorage on the north-west side of it. Sixty-eight miles north 
by east from Bau. 

Naitigilica, (Naitingilitha), a small island on the north-east coast 
of Vanua Levu, about fifteen miles from Undu Point. 

Naitouba, (Naitoumba), an island about five miles in circumference, 
thirty-five miles east by south from Taviuni, and eleven miles north- 
west by west from Vanua \ibalavu, seventy-five miles from Lakemba. 
The island is high, rugged, and of a circular form. The reef does not 
extend above half a mile from it, and has no openings. Subject to 
Somosomo. 

Naivakataqalisaisai, (Naivakatanggalisaisai), a large rock, near

in length, north and south, by seven in breadth, east and west ; it is of 
volcanic formation, and its rocks are composed of a conglomerate, or 
pudding stone ; it is high and rugged throughout. The valleys extend 
only a short distance into the interior, and leave but little level ground ; 
they are, however, exceedingly fertile, with a deep and rich soil, and are 
well cultivated. Its harbours are all formed by the reefs, and were it 
not for these there would be but few in the group ; that at Levuka is safe, 
has good holding ground, and is easy of access. Every island has its 
own peculiar beauty ; Ovalau is the highest, (?) most broken, and most

volcanic formation ; it is covered with luxuriant folinge, and has many- 
fertile valleys, lie thinks that this harbour can be useful only as a tem- 
porary refuge. It is tilled with broken patches, has very irregular

Vanua Levu, ' Great Land, * commonly so called by the natives on 
other islands, but called Vuya by many of the Vanua Levu natives. In 
size it ranks next to Naviti Levu, being one hundred and fifteen miles 
long from east-north-east to west- south-west, or from the extremities of 
Undu and Naithombothonibo, and about twenty-five miles broad on r.n 
average. Navave point lies fifty-seven miles due north from Bau, and is 
the nearest point to it. The principal towns and districts on the south 
side beginning at the west end are, Naithombothombo, Mbua, Ndama, 
Navave, Solevu, Nandi, Navatu, Kumbulau, Nasavusavu, Natuicake from 
Nasavusavu to Thakaundrove ; on the north side or Ndakunivanua, " back 
of the land," as it is called, are, Undu, Namuka, Mouta, Matbuata, Ravi- 
ravi, Wailea, and others. "-The bay of Nasavusavu is a fine sheet of 
deep water, ten miles in length east and west, by five miles in breadth 
from north to south ; it is surrounded by very high and broken land, 
rising in many places into lofty needle-shaped peaks ; it is protected by 
the extensive reef reaching from Nasavusavu point on the east to Kum- 
bulau on the west, excepting a large opening of* about a mile in width, 
two miles distant from Nasavusavu point," i. e. Lesiatheva. " I visited 
the hot springs, which are situated opposite a small island, round which 
a narrow arm of the bay passes, forming a small harbour ; a considerable 
stream of fresh water enters the bay, about a mile above the springs. 
On landing, we found the beach absolutely steaming, and warm water 
oozing through the sand and gravel ; in some places it was too hot to be 
borne by the feet. The hot springs are five in number ; they are situated 
at some distance from the beach, and are nine feet above the level of the 
water ; they occupy a basin forty feet in diameter, about half way be- 
tween the base of the hill and the beach. A small brook of fresh water, 
three feet wide by two deep, passes so close to the basin, that one hand 
may be put into a scalding spring, and the other into water of the tempera- 
ture of seventy-five degrees. That of the spring stands at two hundred 



264 ISLANDS 

to two hundred and ten degrees. The waters join below, and the united 
streams stand at one hundred and forty-five degrees, which diminish in 
temperature until they enter the sea. In the lower part of the bed of 
the united stream excavations have been made, where the natives bathe. 
The rock in the neighbourhood is compact coral and volcanic breccia, 
although it is nowhere to be seen exposed within a third of a mile of the 
spring. The ground above the spring is a deep brown or black mould, 
covered with coarse native grass (a species of scirpus) which is thickly 
matted. There is no smell of sulphur, except when the head is brought 
as close as possible to the water ; but it has a strong saline taste. No 
gas appeared to be disengaged. The basin is in a mixture of blue and 
brown clay, and little grass grows in it. These springs are used by the 
natives to boil their food, which is done by putting the taro or the yams 
into the spring, and covering them up with leaves and grass. Although 
the water scarcely had any appearance of boiling before, rapid ebullition 
ensues. It gurgles up to a height of eight or ten inches, with the same 
noise as is made by a cauldron when over the fire. Taro, yams, etc. that 
were put in, were well done in fifteen minutes. The mouths of the springs 
are from eighteen inches to two feet in diameter, and have apparently 
been excavated by the natives for their own purposes. The account they 
give of them is, that they have always been in the same state since the 
spirit (god) first took up his abode there. They are convinced that he 
still resides there, and the natives say that one spring is kept pure for 
him, which they do not use." " The bay of Nasavusavu may be known by 
a remarkable saddle-shaped peak, lying just behind it j there are several 
other high peaks, that show the interior to be very rugged and high. 
Some of the peaks reach the altitude of four thousand feet."

The islands and reefs are placed with tolerable correctness on the 
latest charts : but the reefs and shoals are so very numerous, that 
navigation in Fiji is still attended with risk ; and, in spite of the 
greatest vigilance, many vessels strike, and some are wrecked. 

The following are some of the wrecks remembered in Fiji : —

REMARKS ON THE ALPHABET. 



The following remarks of the Rev. D. Cargill, M. A., may be ac- 
ceptable, as explanatory of the Fijian alphabet, so far as it differs 
frc'in the English: — " Theprecedinglettershave been selected from 
the English alphabet; butas letters and wordsare merely arbitrary 
signs, and have not necessarily any connection with the sounds 
and ideas which they represent, their powers differ from those of 
their prototypes according to the genius of the Fijian language. 
For instance, the letter b expresses the sound of mb in English ; 
c, that of th ; d, that of nd; g, that of ng; and q is used to 
express that of ng-g. This arrangement affects the orthography 
of some of the foreign words which it is necessary to introduce 
into the Fijian language. In the word baptize, for instance, 
we do not use the Fijian b for the English b, but substitute 
p, which is much nearer the sound of the letter b in English. 
In proper names commencing with d, or in which d occurs, we 
substitute t for d, as in David, which we write Tavita ; if written 
with the d's it would be pronounced Ndavinda." 

" You will perceive that we give the vowels the French sound, 
and that the use of b, c, etc., as signs of the consonantal sounds, 
is a great convenience. Indeed the language would be very 
awkward without such an arrangement, but with it, it is remark- 
ably simple. We do not know that any improvement can be 
made in the alphabet. It is, on the whole, the best we have 
seen, and, we think, reflects great credit on Messrs. Cargill and 
Cross, who were its framers. The language is very easy to read, 
in consequence of having no letters in a word which are not 
sounded, and the sounds of the letters are so uniformly the same, 
that the eye and the ear are seldom at variance. In general, 
though not always, you know the moment you see a word how 
it should be pronounced : the only thing that makes the excep- 
tion to the rule is, that we have no distinction between the long 
and short vowels ; and two of the consonants have a twofold 
sound. To avoid this, and to make a perfect alphabet, would 
require some new characters, which, of course, we do not think 
it would be well to introduce. We think the very best use has 
been made of the English alphabet, in forming one for this 
language."— Rev. John Hunt. 

The alphabet, as just noticed, like those of most languages, 
is both defective and redundant, but its defects and redundancy 
are so slight, that an alteration would be injurious now that it 
is established. Its defects are, that all the vowels, and two of the 
consonants — k and q — represent two sounds; whereas, it is 
desirable to have just so many, and no more, letters in a language, 
as there are simple sounds. Its redundancy is, that three let- 
ters are only inserted in the alphabet for the sake of proper 
names, and some few other words it is necessary to introduce. 



ALPHABET. 

The Letters. 

Letters are divided into vowels and consonants. 
The vowels are a, e, i, o, u ; the rest are consonants. 
The vowels have each a long and short sound, as — 

Long, Short. 



a as in veiba s 

— qeqe-5- 



ulata nearly as short as a in hat. 



leve r a — e in net. 

i — bibl f J. J-tibitibi — i in bit. 

o — v6 *J votavota — o in not. 

a — vuvu£ , uiuaia, shorter sound than u in bull. 

In Fijian we have the following proper diphthongs. There 
are no improper diphthongs. 

ai, as in bai, (a fence) 



au, 
ei, 


— kan, (a tree) 

— vei, (to) 


eu, 
iu, 
ou, 
oi, 


— ceu, (carved) 

— liu, (to precede) 

— dou, (ye) 

— Tcoi, (an article). 




Consonants. 



C. The sound of this letter must not be confounded with the 
hard sound of th in English, as heard in thought, think. It has 
only its soft, or liquid, sound in Fijian, as heard in though, 
those. 

K. This letter represents two sounds, viz.: — that of the English 
k and g. The sound of the English g is heard in the preposition 
ki, to, and its compounds kivei, kina, kiliu, &c. ; and in kila, to 
know, and its compouuds, as, vakatakila, ai vakatakilakila ; and 
in kitaka, vuki, and kece, and perhaps a few other words. It is 
also worthy of remark, that in the transitive terminations -caka, 
-ka, -laka, -maka, -taka, -vaka, and -yaka, k has its proper sound, 
but when the final a in these terminations becomes i, (as in the 
passive, or before a personal pronoun, or proper name) the k has 
the sound of our English g, as kacivaki, pronounced kathivagi. 
This is an extensive use of it. It has also the sound of g in the 
transitive in the Lau dialect,, where these terminations become 
-c ikina, -makina, -lakina, &c. 

Q. This letter also represents two sounds, though that is by 
far the most frequent which is given as its first power in the 
alphabet, viz., the sound of ng-g as heard in younger. The other 
sound is that of ng-k, heard iu younker, tinker. This sound ot 
q is heard in waqa, a canoe ; leqa; saqa, to boil ; and perhaps a few 
others. 

The letters, b, (mb.) d, (nd), g, (ng), and q, ng-g, are found rather 
difficult to the student at first, when they commence a word, or 

1—2

syllable; but there is not one simple sound in Fijian which we 
have not in English. The only difference is, that with us these 
last mentioned sounds, (mb, nd, &c.) always terminate a word or 
syllable; in Fijian they frequently begin one. 

The other consonants require no further observations than 
those given in their powers. 

Of Syllables and Words. 

Either a vowel or consonant may begin a syllable, but vowels 
only can end them, as o-ba, ca-ta, vei-vi-na-ka-ti, not ob-a, cat-a, 
vei-vin-ak-at-i. 

Words are either primitives, or derivatives, or compounds ; as 
primitive, levu, great ; derivative, vakalevu, greatly ; compound, 
yago-levu, big-bodied. 

Again, words are divided into monosyllables, or words of one 
syllable; dissyllables, or words of two syllables; trisyllables, or 
words of three syllables ; polysyllables, or words of four or more 
syllables. In Fijian all simple words, or roots, are almost 
without exception either monosyllables or dissyllables, but 
mostly the latter. Derivatives and compounds are generally 
trisyllables or polysyllables. 

Any of the vowels may terminate words, but a and i only 
terminate the definite transitive form of verbs. 



ETYMOLOGY. 

Etymology treats of the Classification, Inflection, and Deriva- 
tion of words. 

Classification is the arrangement of words into their different 
sorts, called Parts of Speech. 

Inflection is that change which the forms of words undergo in 
order to express their different relations. 

Derivation is that part which treats of the origin and primary 
signification of words. 

1. CLASSIFICATION. 

In Fijian as in English there are nine classes, or sorts of 
words, or parts of speech, viz. — 1 Articles; 2. Nouns, or Sub- 
stantives; 3. Adjectives; 4. Pronouns; 5. "Verbs; 6. Adverbs; 
7. Prepositions ; 8. Conjunctions ; 9. Interjections. For the 
definitions of these, see the Grammars. 

2. INFLECTION.— I. ON THE ARTICLES. 

The articles are ko or o ; koi or oi ; a or na; ai or nai. There 
are properly but two, ko and na ; but the above includes the 
different forms which these two may absum* 1 



ARTICLES. 5 

Of ho or o ; hoi or oi. 

They are used before the personal pronouns. Ko or o, and 
koi or oi, seem to be used interchangeably before the personal 
pronoun; as — ko keda, or koi keda, &c, excepting that the 
1st person singular au takes koi or oi only (koi au), and the 2nd 
and 3rd person singular and 3rd plural take o or ko only (ko iko, ko 
koya, ko ira). See the pronouns fur examples of the rest. 

Of ho or o only. 

Ko or o is used before all proper names ; as — 
Proper names of person?, as ko or o Tui Viti, ko or o Joni. 

,, ,, ,, places, as k > or o Bau. 

,, ,, ,, islands, as ko or o Lakeba. 

,, official names, as ko Vasulevu, ko Roko tui Bau. 

There are other words which are really proper names, and 
which take ko as their article, though they are not treated as 
proper names in English : as, ko vuravura, the world ; ko lagi, 
or lomalagi, the sky ; ko bulu, hades, or the invisible world. 

" Sometimes ko is prefixed to words which express relationship, 
as, ko tamaqu, my father ; ko tinamu, tby mother, but in such 
cases the common noun seems to be raised to the rank of a 
proper name, and ko usurps the place of the article a ; for a 
tamaqu, a tinamu, are as proper as ko tamaqu, and ko tinamu." 
Mr. Cargill thought a tamaqu, &c , more proper ; but I think the 
commonness of the former, as well as the " genius of the lan- 
guage," renders it as proper as the latter. 

Sometimes ko is prefixed with na to any common noun, appa- 
rently for the sake of greater definidveness — a, of itself, being 
indefinite — as, ko na marama, the lady; ko na turaga, the 
gentleman (or chief), alluding to some particular one. 

N.B. O is the same as ko, k being sometimes omitted for the 
sake of euphony, chiefly at the beginning of a sentence. 

Of a, na, ai and nai. 

These are substantially the same article ; they are used chiefly, 
1. Before common nouns, a?, a tamata, a man. 2. Before pos- 
sessive pronouns, as a noda, ours. 3. Before verbs when they 
have a participial sense, a?, o ira na soko, those sailing; here, 
however, tamata may be understood, as o ira na tamata sa soko. 
4. It is used before particles which indicate the possessive case, 
as a nei, a mei, a kei. Heuce, a, na, &c, is evidently an indefinite 
article. 

Distinctions in the use of these different forms of the 
indefinite article. 

I. AS IT REGARDS THE INITIAL N IN NA AND NAI. 

A and ai are generally (but not always) used at the beginning 
of a sentence ; and nu and nai only are used in the middle. 



6 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

Hence, na always precedes nouns in the objective case, when 
immediately preceded by tbe transitive verb, or preposition ; as, 
ki na tamata ; e na vale ; mai na vanua ; kitaka na ka o qo ; not, 
ki a tamata ; e a vale ; &c. 

Eitber a or na, ai or nai, may be used at tbe beginning of a 
sentence, but a or ai is more common; as a tamata o qo, or na 
tamata o qo ; ai valu, or nai valu ; but tbe former are preferable. 
But when the vocative case begins a sentence, na only is proper; 
as, na bete ; na veiwekani. 

II. AS IT REGARDS TBE FINAL I. 

This difference is more important than that with respect to the 
n. For the article with the i affixed can only precede certain 
nouns, whereas the n may be prefixed when used before any 
kind of noun. 

The classes of words which must be preceded by -i, (whether 
the article, or a noun, or poss. pronoun, or a verb, or a particle, be 
the word which precedes these classes of words,) are chiefly the 
following : — 

1. Nouns formed from active verbs, which nouns are the instru- 
ments by which the action expressed in the verb is effected ; as, 
ai qeu, from qeu-ta; ai sele, from sele-va ; ai tukituki, from 
tuki-a ; &c. I remember but one exception, viz., a uli (ni waqa), 
from uli-a; but perhaps this is to distinguish it from ai uli, from 
uli-a, to stir liquids. A cina, from cinava, cannot well be called 
an exception — lor ai cina is also used in some dialects. 

Mr. Lyth suggests — 4 'As it regards the reason of this pecu- 
liarity it is difficult to assign one with certainty ; but it may 
probably be, that the ai is compounded of a, the, and i, of, or for, 
and signify the thing of or for a certain use ; the use being denoted 
by the correlative verb — derivatively related to the noun — as in 
the words ai tilotilo, the throat, lit. the swallower, from tilo, to 
swallow. Be this as it may, it is a fact that it is to this class 
of nouns that this prefix principally belongs." 

2. Nouns derived from neuter verbs, which express the place or 
position in which the state of being occurs which is expressed in 
the neuter verb ; as, ai tutu, a place to stand in or on, from tu, 
to stand ; ai kotokoto, a place to lie in or on, from koto, to lie; 
ai mocemoce, a place to sleep in, or a bed, from moce, to sleep. 

3. Nouns from verbs which generally describe the mode of an 
action ; as, au sa sega ni kila na kenai cakacaka , I do not know how 
it is done; au sega ni kila na kenai doladola, I do not know 
how it is opened, or how to open it ; au sa sega ni kila na kenai 
cavucavu ni vosa o qori, I know not how to prone unce that word, 
or how it is pronounced ; au sa vinakata na kenai kanakana, 1 
like the eat of it, &c. Most verbs may, by reduplication, become 
nouns of this class, and take the -i preceding them in this way, 

The article a or na precedes nouns in the singular, dual, and 



NOUNS. 7 

plural numbers, and in either the masculine, feminine, or neuter 
genders. As, a tagane, a male ; a yalewa, a female ; a vale, a 
house ; a veivale, houses. 

II. OF NOUNS. 

On the derivation and different classes of Nouns. 

1. Norms, which are names of all natural objects, celestial and 
terrestrial, as the names of the heavenly bodies, trees, animals, 
and natural productions generally, are mostly primitive or un- 
derived words. As, a tamata, a man; a waqa, a canoe; a were, 
a garden; a gone, a child; a siga, the sua; a vanua, a land. 
These take the article a before them, and not ai. 

2. All adjectives are used as abstract nouns ; as, vinaka, good, 
goodness; ca, bad, badness; levu, great, greatness; vulavula, 
white, whiteness, &c. These abstract nouns generally require the 
pronoun nona, or kena, to precede them, instead of simply the 
article na ; as, au sa sega ni kila na kena yaga na ka ko ya, I do 
not know the usefulness of that thing. The form, au sa sega ni 
kila na yaga ni ka ko ya, is not so common or proper. But this 
belongs properly to Syntax. 

3. But the verbs are the most fruitful source of nouns in the 
Fijian. Almost all nouns which express actions, agents, and in- 
struments, are derived from verbs. 

i. Nouns expressive of actions themselves, or the effects of 
actions, viz., works, or things made, are commonly derived from 
verbs. The simple forms of the verbs are used as nouns ; as, a 
butako, a theft ; a lako, a going ; a soko, a sailing, or voyaging ; 
a vosa, a speaking, or word, or speech ; a tiko, a sitting, or resi- 
dence; a masu, a prayer, or praying. Sometimes the transitive, 
sometimes the passive, forms of the verb are used as nouas of 
action ; as, " Sa tautauvata na kakua ni cudruvi nai valavala ca, 
kei na vakadonui kei na vokibauti keda tale me da luve ni Kalon, 
se segai ? " Should it not be kakua ni cudruva ? A vakabauf i 
Karisito, belief or faith in Christ; na tawa dinata na vosa ni 
Kalou, unbelief in the word of God. The transitive termination 
of the verb answers here to the preposition which follows the noun 
with us. Frequently the reciprocal form of the verb is used as a 
noun ; as, a veivakacacani, a spoiling, destruction, or persecution ; 
a veivinakati, amity, reconciliation; a veicati, hatred, enmity; a 
veimoku, slaughter, a killing each other; a veivala, or veiva- 
luti, war, or a fighting with each other ; a veivuke, mutual help. 
The reduplicated or partly-reduplicated form of a verb is fre- 
quently used as a noun of action, and frequently of an instrument 
oi tue action also; as, ai vakatakilakila, a showing, or demonstra- 
tion ; also a thing that makes known; a mark or sign: as, ai 
vakadinadina, a confirmation or ratification ; also a thing, or 
circumstance, that coniirms ; a vakatatovotuvo, a trial, or attempt ; 
ai tukutuku, a reporting, or declaration, or confession, also a 



8 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

report. For another class of nouns of action, see nnder the art. 
Ai, II. 3. 

ii. Nouns expressing agents or actors are formed from the verbs 
in different ways, but chiefly by the prefixes dau, or dauvei ; as, 
a daubutako, a thief; a dautukutuku, a reporter, or witness; a 
dauvosa, an incessant talker, or busy-body; adaulaba, a murderer, 
or one given to laba; a dauveivakarusai, a destroyer, or destruc- 
tion ; a dauveivakacalai, a deceiver, deception ; a dauveibeitaki, 
an accuser. But the agent is sometimes expressed by three words, 
as, a dau ni vucu, a poet, or dancing-master ; a dau ni waqa, a 
aailor, or one who understands canoes; a dau ni kesa, a dyer, or 
one who understands marking cloth. 

iii. Nouns expressing the instruments by which an agent per- 
forms an action are derived from verbs ; as, ai seru, a comb ; ai 
cula, a fork, or needle ; ai iri, a fan ; ai iki, a short thick stick for 
beating cloth ; ai sele, a knife. A matan, an axe, has no corre- 
sponding verb, and therefore takes the article a instead of si. 
Ai vakabula, a thing or person that saves ; ai vakamate, a thing 
that killpo 

iv. The names of many vocal animals are onomatopoeial, or are 
derived from the sounds made by the animals ; as a kaka ; a kikau ; 
a sese. Some names of plants describe some quality possessed 
by them. 

v. Diminutives made by reduplication; as, a civaciva, a small 
kind of oyster; a vesivesi, an inferior kind of vesi ; a valevale, a 
small house, generally, the house on canoes, 
vi. Proper name?. 

The above classes of nouns appear to be clearly distinct, and 
their formation well worihy of observation. Nmns of the first 
and fourth classes must be learned individually, in the first 
instance, from the native?, and cannot be increased or formed at 
pleasure. But most of the nouns of other classes may be formed 
almost at will by one moderately acquainted with the language, 
and are evidently so formed by the natives. 

It is also worthy of remark, that the nouns of the first class 
never take ai as their preceding article. 

vii. Another class remains to be mentioned, viz. : those nouns 
which take the possessive pronouns post fixed, instead of prefixed ; 
ae, yavana is used instead of nona yava. 

These are either 1, the membtrs of the body, or parts of a 
thing; or, 2, nouns which express relationship. In fact, relation- 
ship is perhaps the more prominent feature in this form, of speech, 
for the possessive pronouns seldom, or never, follow the noun 
ia this way, unless there be relation or intimate connection 
between the possessor and the possessed. Thus luve, which 
n turally implies relationship, viz., that of a son or daughter, 
always takes the possessive pronoun postfixed, as luvena ; but 
gone, a child, which does not naturally imply a relationship, 
always takes the possessive pronoun before it, aa nona gone, his 



NOUNS. 9 

jhild, i. e that is his to bring up or look after. Again, uluqu, my 
jwn head; but a kequ ulu (ni vuaka, &c), my head, but mine to 
>at. A suiqn, a bone of my body ; a noqu sui, my bone, mine in 
possession, but not a bone of my body ; yacaqn, my name ; noqu 
vaca, my namesake ; vasuda, our nephew; noda va.su, the vasu to 
our town, or chief; dou kila, saka, mada, me bula na nomu liga 
ni yaqona, a form of address to the gods, not ligamu ni yaqona ; 
a tikiqn, a part of me ; a noqu tikina, my part, or place. Unless 
relationship as well as possession were implied, we could see no 
reason why we should not use gonequ, as well as luvequ, and uluqu 
and suiqu in the latter cases as well as in the former. All nouns 
which postfix the pronouns will be found noticed in the Dictionary 
by ,-na being placed after them. 

Inflection of Nouns. 

To nouns belong the properties of genders, numbers, and oases. 

1. Genders of Nouns. 

All Fijian nouns, when used without tagane or alewa following), 
ve of the common gender, i.e. are either masculine, feminine, or 
neuter ; except the following. 

Masculine. Feminine. 

a tagane, a male a alewa, a female 

a tain viia, a father a tina,-na, a mother 

a turaga, a chief a marama, a lady 

a tuka, a grandfather a bu-ua (a tubu-na or ai tubu- 

tuba), a grandmother 
a tui, a sau, a king a ranadi, or radi, a queen 

a sara, a male or boar pig a tinatina, a sow 

ai talatala, (generally mas.) a vada, a maidservant 

messenger 
ratu, sir adi, madam 

lei, (ta, tu, tua) na, nana, nau 

a tinatina, an animal that has 
had young, as a vuaka tina- 
tina, a toa tinatina 
*a volakete 
*a daulato 

For the peculiar change of gender in several nouns of relation- 
ship, as dauve-na, davola-na, gane-na, vugo-na, &c, see these 
words in the Dictionary. 

Bat some nouns of relationship are of the common gender ; as, 
a luvena, a son or daughter; also offspring; a wati, a husband 
or wife. 

The genders of all other nouns, (and of these last named,) are 
distinguished by the use of tagane or atagane, and alewa after 
he nouns : e g. 



10 Fij&AN Grammar. 

Masculine. Ft minine. 

a gone tagane, a boy a gone yalewa, a giw 

a toa tagane, a cock a toa yalewa, a hen 

a koli tagane, a dog a koli yalewa, a bitch. 

A tamata is an exception ; for though tamata signifies either 
a man or woman — mankind ; yet tamata tagane and tamata 
alewa do not seem to be used, but simply tagane and alewa instead. 

2. Number of Nouns. 

There are no terminations in Fijian nouns to express different 
numbers. But by prefixing dua, one, or any other numeral, or 
vei, or a personal pronoun, a noun may become either singular, 
dual, or plural; and this is the common way of distinguishing 
the different numbers in Fijian. Another singular feature in the 
language is, that there are some nouns to express certain things 
only, by tens, hundreds, &c, as will be presently shown. 

It has already been observed, that the articles do not dis- 
tinguish the numbers. 

We shall begin with the numeral singular sign — dua. This is 
the most common sign of the singular number, and when it 
precedes nouns seems to be more properly considered as a sign of 
the singular number than as a numeral. For it does not, in such 
a situation, admit of lewe before it as it does when used as a 
numeral; as, e dua na turaga levu o <]o, this is a great chief. We 
cannot say, e lewe dua na turaga levu o qo. But when used as a 
numeral we can ; as, a turaga levu e lewe dua, one great chief. 
See more under Dua in the Dictionary. 

1. Dua, then, we would consider as a definite sign of the 
singular number, and of very great importance as such, as 
restricting nouns to a definite sense, when without it their sense 
would be very vague. As, E dua na tamata ka tiko e na vanua 
ko Usi ; there was a man (a certain man) in the land of Uz. 
Omit the dua, and the sense is most indefinite ; as, A tamata ka 
tiko e na vanua ko Usi. 

2. Yei. This word prefixed to nouns indicates a plural, or 
collective number, and is therefore very useful, as showing 
that many, not one, nor seldom a few things, are implied ; 
whereas when no sign precedes a noun it may imply one, or a 
thousand. 

Vei, however, is not used before all nouns, as we cannot say, a 
veitamata, men ; a veikoli, dogs : but a veikoro, the towns ; a 
veivanua, lands, countries; a veicakau, the reefs; a veiwere, the 
gardens; a veivale, the houses; &c. Nouns which can take 
the vei prefixed as a plural or collective sign are generally so 
noted in the Dictionary, but others will be found which are not 
noticed. 

It appears very probable that all nouns were formerly redu- 
plicated when they took the vei, as is still the case with some 



NOUNS. 



11 



norms, and I think *ith all nouns in some dialects, as at Nandy. 
As a veiniuniu, a veivudivudi, a veicakacakau, a veivanuvanua, 
a veikorokoro, veivalevale, a veikacukacu, a veicoco, &c. But the 
Bau people, who generally seem to aim at brevity, seldom redu- 
plicate the nouns thus. 

3. Another mode of distinguishing the numbers of the nouns in 
Fijian is by the personal pronouns : e. g. 

Sing. — O koya na tamata, the man 
Dual — Oi rau na tamata, the two men 
Plural — ira na tamata, the men. 

But here also will be found a difficulty at first, for the per- 
sonal pronouns cannot be so used before all nouns. They are 
used — 

1. Before rational beings, as gods, angels, devils, and men ; 
as, o ira na kalou, o ira na agilose, o ira na tevoro, o ira na 
tamata, o ira na gone, o ira na cauravou, o ira na wekada, o ira 
na kai vuravura, o ira na kai noda. Before the above classes of 
noun 8 they are used with the strictest propriety. 

2. Sometimes, but not generally, before the inferior animals ; 
as, o ira na koli, o ira na kalavo, &c, are occasionally used : but 
the strict propriety of this use of them seems very doubtful, as 
general usage does not countenance it. 

3. The latter remark applies with still greater force in reference 
to their use before vegetable and inanimate objects. O ira na 
kau may sometimes be heard ; but the nouns then seem to be 
personified. 

4. They cannot be used before nouns of action; as, o ira na 
cakacaka, works, does not appear to be native. 

Perhaps most nouns which cannot take the pronouns thus 
prefixed will admit of the prefix vei; and those which will admit 
ol vei will rarely admit of the pronouns. 

The following nouns imply a definite number of the things 
they represent. Most of them express a decimal number. 

Sing. Dual. 

a niu a buku niu, two nuts. 

Plural. Tens. 

a waqa a uduudu, ten canoes 

a uto a sole or tura, ten bread-fruit 

a niu a buru, ten cocoa-nuts 

a dovu *a qolo, ten pieces of sugarcane 

a vonu a bi, ten turtles 

a ika a bola, ten fishes 

a vudi a bewa, ten bunches of bananas 

a vuaka a rara, ten pigs 

a tabua a vulo, ten whales' teeth 

a vakalolo a wai, ten native puddings 



12 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

Sirg. Plural. Tens. 

a lairo *a doi, t^n land crabs 

a kuita # a dali, ten cuttle-fishes 

a vasua *a matau, ten vasuas 

a tabakau a kau, ten mats made of the cocoa-nut leaves 

a ibi a sasa, ttn mats 

a moto a tuatua, ten spears 

ai wau a bure, ten clubs 

a toa a soga, ten fowls 

a kuro a sava, ten pots. 

Hundreds. 
a waqa a bola, cne hundred canoes 

a niu a koto, one hundred nuts. 

Thousands. 
a niu a selavo, one thousand cocoa-nuU 

These, like nouns of multitude, will admit of the numerals to 
define their number ; as. e dua na soga, ten fowls ; e rua na vulo, 
twenty whales' teeth; e tolu na rara, thirty p'g3. 

3. Cases of Nouns. 

The different cases of nouns, or pronouns, denote the different 
relations which the nouns or pronouns bear to one another, or to 
other words, or to a whole sentence. They also exhibit the 
person or thing to us in different capacities. As in the sentence, 
Abraham offered up his son Isaac. Abraham is represented as 
acting, in the first part of the sentence; then as being in possession 
of a thing ; and Isaac, the possessed, is represented as the object 
of an action. Abraham is represented to us in two different 
aspects, and Isaac in one different from either. 1. Abraham does 
something : 2. Abraham lias something : 3. Isaac suffers some- 
thing, or is the recipient of an action. The difference of the 
aspects in which Abraham and Isaac are brought before us, is 
sufficiently obvious, and it is this difference which the several 
cases are designed to represent. If there were nothing in the 
words themselves, or in the manner in which they were placed, 
to indicate these different aspects ; or, in other words, if there were 
no different cases, language would be an unintelligible jumble of 
sounds — e. g. : Sa cabora naluvena ko Eparaama ko Aisake ; or, sa 
cabora na luvena ko Aisake ko Eparaama ; or, sa cabora na luvena 
Eparaama Aisake; or, sa cabora na luvena Aisake Eparaama. 

The above is utterly unintelligible; and so must all language 
be if there were nothing to indicate the different cases of nouns. 
But when we say, Sa c.ibori Aisake na luvena ko Eparaama, 
we cannot be misunderstood. Such is the importance of the 
different cases ot nouns or pronouns. 

The cases are distinguished in different wajs in different 
languages. But the more general way is by different terminations 



NOUNS. *3 

of the noun or pronoun ; as, he, his, him, they, theirs, them. But 
this is n< t the manner in which the various cases are shown in 
Fjian. la Fijian they are chiefly shown by particles which 
precede the nouns. 

The different wavs in which the same case is formed in different 
words give rise to declensions of nouns ; and as the same cases are 
formed in different ways in Fijian, we may properly form different 
declensions. 

We will consider three : Of common nouns — of proper names 
of persons — and of proper names of places. 

1. Declension of common nouns. 

(1.) Wlien indefinite : 

The nominative case is indicated by the article a or na. The 
possessive by the sign ni (rarely by i), and the objective and 
vocative cases by na : e. g. 

Nom. — a or na tamata, a man, men, or mankind 
Poss. — ni tamata, of a man, men, or mankind 

— kei na tamata, of or concerning a man, men, etc. 
Obj. — na tamata, a or the man, men, or mankind 
Voc. — aa tamata. 

When ni precedes a noun which takes i before it, one i is gene- 
rally omitted in writing, though not in correct speaking; as ai 
yaragi nii valu, written ai yaragi ni valu ; mata ni vola, for mata 
nii vola. 

(2.) When the noun is definite : 

The cases are indicated by the pronouns, viz , the nom., obj., 
and voc. cases are shown by the personal, and the possessive case 
by the possessive pronouns : e. g. 

Singular. 

Nom. — o or ko koya na tamata, the man 

Poss. — a nona (a nena, a kena, a mena) na tamata, the man's 

Obj. — koya na tamata, the man 

Voc. — o iko na tamata, man. 

Literally, nom., he the man; poss., his the man; obj., him 
the man ; voc, you the man. 

For the difference in sense between nona (or nena), kena and 
mena, see "Remarks on the possessive signs" p. 15. 

Dual. 

Nom. — oi or koi rau ua tamata, the two men 

Poss. — a nodrau (a nedrau, a kedrau, a medrau,) na tamata, the 

two men's 
Obj — rau na tamata, the two men 
Voc. — oi kemudrau na tamata, you two men. 

Literally, nom., they two the men ; poss., their two the men • 
obj., them two the men ; voc, you two the men. 



14 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

Plural. 

Nom. — o or ko ira na tamata, the men 

Poss. — a nodra (a nedra, a kedra, a medra,) na tamata, the men's 

Obj. — ira na tamata, the men 

T"oc. — oi kemudou or kemuni na tamata, ye men. 

Literally, nom., they the men; poss., theirs the men's ; obj., 
ihem the men ; voc, ye the men. 

It must be kept in mind, however, that the pronouns are not 
thus used before all kinds of common nouns. See p. 11, 3, 4. 

(3.) Example of a noun with dua. 

Nom. — e dua na tamata 

Poss. — ni dua na tamata 

a nona, a nena, a kena, a mena, e dua na tamata 

Obj. — edua na tamata, with a verb ; na dua na tamata, with a pre- 
position ; as, au sega ni cata e dua na tamata ; au a 
kauta ki na dua na tamata mai ka. 

(4.) Irregulars. 

There are a few common nouns which are irregular in the pos- 
sessive case, some taking i instead of ni, and some having no 
possessive sign. 

Examples : Of those which take {instead of ni ; as, a vula i uca, 
months of rain ; a vula i katakata, months of heat ; a vula i were- 
were, months of gardening ; a vula i magomago. Also nouns of 
relationship; as, ai wau i tamaqu; ai vola i tinaqu. Of those 
which take neither — a kai vanua, a kai wai, a kai noda, a kai 
Lakeba. 

Tui takes neither where it precedes a proper name of a place, as 
tui Bua, which is easily accounted for ; but is regular when it 
precedes a common noun, as, a tui ni vanua. The omission of 
the sign after kai can also be accounted for when it precedes the 
proper name of a place, but not when it precedes a common noun. 
Nothing is more common than the omission of one of two similar 
letters, or syllables, when such letters or syllables happen to 
come together; as, in tui i Lakeba, kai i Lakeba, one of the'i's 
would naturally be omitted. Other examples of the like omis- 
sion : — kevaka'u for kevaka ka'u, ka'u for ka au, vakalougatataka 
for vakakalougatataka. In the following instances also the pos- 
sessive sign is constantly omitted in the Bau, though not in all 
dialects: loma lagi for loma ni lagi, Ion a sere for loma ni sere, 
vata laca for vata ni laca, sau laca for sau ni laca, ma' a dravu for 
mata ni dravu, mala sawa for mata ni saw ana. This usage is in 
strict conformity with the Hebrew, which in general has nothing 
more than a change of accent to denote the possessive case. 

Another class of irregulars is formed by altering, generally by 
shortening, the word which precedes the poss. case, or other 
defining word. As,

vorovoro voroka,-na 

yasayasa yasa,-na 

wasawasa wasa (liwa) 

sulisuli suli,-na 

sausau sanka,-na 

vutivuti vutika,-na 

There is another form of speech in which the possessive sign 
is always omitted in Fijian, though not in English. The con- 
tained is expressed in the Eaglish and other languages as pos- 
sessed by the container ; as, a basket of bread, a bottle of oil ; but 
this is never the case in Fijian ; as, they would not say, a kato ni 
madrai, but, a kato madrai ; not, a tavaya ni waiwai, but, a tavaya 
waiwai ; a su ika, a basket of fish ; a saqa madrai, a cask of flour. 
For the difference between these forms with and without the 
possessive sign, see Ni in the Dictionary. 

To the above idiom must also be referred words compounded 
of mata, and taba, with some others; as, mata bete, a company of 
priests; matai valu, a company of warriors; mata veiwekani, a 
company of friends ; mata qali, a company of the same district, or 
a tribe ; taba tamata, men of the same age ; taba dalo, dalo 
planted at the same time ; taba yabaki, a season of the year ; ulu 
vatu, rocky eminences; qara vatu, a cave, or a cavern, in a rock. 

2. Declension of proper names of persons. 
Nom. — o or ko Cakobau 

Poss. — i (a nei, a kei, a mei,) Cakobau, Cakobau's 
Obj. — Cakobau 
Voc. — Cakobau or i Cakobau 

It may be varied by the pronouns like common nouns : thus— 
Nom. — o or ko koya ko Cakobau, Cakobau 
Poss. — a nona (a nena, a kena, a mena,) ko Cakobau, Cakobau's 
Obj. — koya, vua, ko Cakobau, Cakobau: but this objective form 
is not so common. 

Nouns of relationship are frequently declined like proper 
names of persons ; as, nom., ko tamaqu ; poss., i tamaqu ; obj ., 
tamaqu. 

3. Declension of proper names of places. 

Nom. — o or ko Bau, Bau 

Poss. — ni or i Bau, of or in the possession of Bau 

kei Bau, of or concerning Bau 
Obj.— Bau. 

Remarks on the possessive signs. 

These, as seen above, are ni, i, nei, kei, mei, and the possessive 
pronouns, sing., nona or nena, kena, mena; dual, nodrau or 



16 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

nedrau, kedrau, medrau ; plural, nodra or nedra, kedra, medra — 
to which might have been added nodratou, or nedratou, kedratou, 
medratou. 

1. As to their sense. 

Ni, i. nei, nona or nena, nodrau or nedrau, nodratou or nedra- 
tou, nodra or nedra, seem to express simply the possession of any 
thing. 

Kei, kena, kedrau. kedratou, kedra, imply : 1. The possession of 
a thing to be eaten ; not merely the possession of an eatable 
thing : as, a nona uvi, his yam, to plant or sell or give away or 
keep ; but, a kena uvi is his yam to eat. They are also used when 
speaking about the pots or dishes employed about one's food; as 
a kena kuro, which is the same as a kuro ni kena. 2. They fre- 
quently do not imply possession at all, but about or concerning ; 
as, nai rogorogo kei Cakobau, the report about or concerning 
Cakobau. 3. They sometimes imply a thing employed about, or 
with reference to, a person ; as a kena m»lumu, his club, not his in 
possession, but the club with, which he is to be killed. See under 
Kena in the Dictionary. 

Mei, mena. medrau, medratou, medra, imply : 1. The possession 
of a thing to be drunk, and not merely the possession of a drink- 
able thing. As nona wai and kena wai are proper as well as mena 
wai, but they do not imply water to be drunk. 2. They are used 
when speaking about drinking vessels, or vessels to contain 
drink ; as, mena bilo ni waibuta. 3. They are also used when 
speaking of some soft or sloppy kinds of food ; as, a mena ba ni 
dalo, a mena dovu. 

2. As to their forms or derivation. 

Ni and i are simple words. All the rest appear to be com- 
pounds. Nei, kei, and mei, are compounded of ne, ke, me, 
(which are undoubtedly nouns, whatever might originally be 
their sense,) and i, of. That they are nouns will appear : 1. Be- 
cause they take the article like nouns, which ni and i cannot do. 
2. They exactly answer to ni, or i, with an article and noun before 
it : as, a nei Varani, is the same as, a ka i Yarani ; a kei Yarani, 
as a kakana i Yarani ; a mei Yarani as a wai i Yarani : hence we 
consider a nei, or kei, or mei, if uncom pounded would be written, 

a ne (the thing) i (of) Yarani. 

a ke (the food) i (of) Yarani 

a me (the drink) i (of) Yarani. 

But the vowels e and i (ne i) combine and form a diphthong, 
so that they are better written together. 

To ne, (or no, which is the same in the possessive pronouns as 
ne,) ke, and me, are added the pronominal postfixes -qu, -mu, -na, 
-da, -drau, -dra, &c, and thus are formed the possessive pronouns 
with their different senses; some of which pronouns, as seen 
above, are used also as possessive signs.

Examples . A nequ, that is, a ne -qu, formed like ulu-qu ; a 
neuiu, that is, a ne -inu, formed like ulu-mu; a nena, that is, a

a kena, a ke -na ; a mequ, a me -qu ; a memn, a me -mu ; a mena, 
a me -na ; a memudrau, a me -mudrau ; a kemudrau, a ke -lnu-

kedratou, a ke -dratou ; a nedra, a ne -dra ; a kedra, a ke -dra ; a 
m^dra, a me -dra. 

For the use of the possessive sign ni, when used to express the 
genitive of the object, and for instances of the omission of it when 
we should use a possessive sign in Eoglish, see under Ni in the 
Dictionary. 

In English and some other languages, where two nouns come 
together, the possessive sign is commonly before the latter, when 
no possession is implied ; as, the city of Loudon. This is not the 
case in Fijian. The latter noun in such cases remains in the 
nominative case; as, na koro ko Lodoni; not, na koro ni Lodoni. 

III. OF ADJECTIVES. 

Adjectives are a class of words which express the quality, as of 
goodness or badness, size, shape, colour, number, quantity, or 
other property of the nouns to which they are joined, or to 
which they belong — for they are not always in immediate con- 
junction with their nouns. As, a good man, the man is good. 

1. On the derivation and classes of Adjectives. 

(1.) A great number of adjectives appear to be primitive 
words ; as, ca, bad ; vinaka, good ; balavu, long ; levu, great ; 
lailai, small. 

(2.) Most of the nouns of the first class can be used as adjec- 
tives ; as, a bure kalou, a god's house ; a waqa voce, a paddling 
canoe; a vuaka uro, a fat pig; <&c., where kalou (a god), voce (a 
paddle), and uro (fat), are used as adjectives. 

(3.) Some are formed by the reduplication of a noun; some 
with, some without, the addition of another syllable; as, qeleqelea, 
dirty — from qele, earth ; dukadukali, dirty — from duka, dirt ; 
soqosoqoa, covered with rubbish ; ulouloa, maggoty — from ulo, a 
maggot; dregadregata, gluey— from drega, glue or gum. 

(4.) There are two classes of adjectives formed from nouns by 
prefixing vaka to them : the first class implying similitude, as 
vakatamata, manlike ; Vakaviti, Fiji-like : the second class 
implying possession, as vakavale, having a house ; vakawere, 
having a garden. See more fully under Yaka in the Dictionary. 

(5.) Different forms of the verb are used as adjectives: 1. The 
simple form of the verb reduplicated ; as, drodro, flowing ; dredre, 
difficult — from dre, to pull at. 2. The passive form ; as, rerevaki, 
fearful; lomani, pitiable; domoni, desirable; sevaki, hateful. 

2 



18 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

3. The reciprocal form of the verb ; as, veivakidacalataki, won- 
derful, exciting wonder; dauveivakamatei, deadly, causing death; 
dauveivakarusai, destructive: dauveivakacalai, deceitful, causing to 
err. See under Dau in the Dictionary. 4. The intransitive form 
of all verbs ; as, a (tamata) daucukaeaka, an industrious man ; (a 
tamata) dauvosa, a tatler ; (a tamata) daucudru, an ill-natured 
man ; (a tamata) loloma, a loving man. 5. Yerbs with the pre- 
fixes Tea, ta, and ra, as kavoro, broken; tamusu, cut in pieces; 
ramusu, broken. See under Ta and Ka in the Dictionary. Per- 
haps these are more properly passive forms of the verbs. 6. Adjec- 
tives expressive of colours are mostly reduplicated words, when 
used alone, as, loaloa, black ; damudamu, red ; vulavula, white ; 
karakarawa, green, blue : but when they follow a noun, they are 
sometimes used in their simple form, as, a vuaka damu, a red 
pig. 

The above are considered different classes, from the different 
manner in which they are formed in Fijian. 

"We shall now classify the adjectives according to their sense. 

" Adjectives may be divided into six classes — Common, Proper 
Numeral, Pronominal, Yerbal, and Compound." 

I. COMMON ADJECTIVES. 

Those of the first, second, and third classes given above are 
adjectives of this class. 

II. PROPER ADJECTIVES. 

All Fijian adjectives of this class are formed like those of 
the fourth class given above. When the vaka is prefixed to a 
common noun, it makes a common adjective ; but when it is pre- 
fixed to a 'proper noun, it makes a proper adjective; e. g. Vakaviti, 
Fijian ; Vakavarani, French ; Yakaroma, Roman. Proper adjec- 
tives should always commence with a capital, as well as proper 
nouns. 

III. NUMERAL ADJECTIVES. 

We now name numeral adverbs as well, and reckon five 
classes — cardinals, ordinals, distributives, collectives, adverbial 
number of times. See Table at the end, I. 

IV. PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES. 

Pronominal adjectives are sometimes joined to nouns, some- 
times used alone. Pronominal aojectives may be divided into 
four kinds — Possessives, Distributives, Demonstratives, and 
Indefinites. 

But as most of these partake of the nature both of adjectives 
and jironoans, some grammarians treat of them under the head of 
pronouns ; and we prefer this arrangement as it regards the pos- 



ADJECTIVES. 19 

sessives and demonstratives. We shall therefore only mention 
the distributives and indefinites here. 

1. Distributives. These are expressed in English by such 
words as each, every, cither, neither, etc. The sense of each has 
been given in the distributive numerals. Ya and tauya are the 
distributive particles prefixed to numerals ; as, yadua, each, every 
one, individually. Dui (or duai) has also the nature of a dis- 
tributive adjective, and is prefixed to verbs or nouns; as, era sa 
dui lako ki na nona vale, each of them has gone to his own 
house ; era dui vosavosa, each of them speaks a different tongue ; 
era dui tinatina, each of them has a different mother; era dui 
kaikai, they are each inhabitants of different places. The noun 
which is distributed by the dui is mostly reduplicated, as seen in 
the above examples. Dili is doubtless a corruption of duai, which 
is still used in most of the dialects. 

Every is generally expressed in Fijian by kece, or kecega, 
kecekece, or kecekecega. 

Either is also not unfrequently expressed by kecega, or by one 
of the collective numerals ; as, which of these is suitable ? a cava 
vei rau e yaga, or vinaka ? either, sa yaga ruarua, or sa yaga 
kecega. 

Neither is expressed by sa sega ; as, a cava vei rau (or ira) sa 
yaga ? sa sega ; or, sa sega e yaga kina, or, sa sega vei rau e 
yaga kina. 

2. Indefinites. These are expressed in English by many, 
much, several, few, all, none, some, any, one, other, another. 

Many, when persons are referred to, e lewe vuqa (or e le vuqa), 
or e lewe levu (or e le levu). The former appears to be more 
proper in the Bau dialect. Whenfjthings are reterred to, omit the 
lewe, or le; as, e vuqa, or e levu. A ka tani is also frequently 
used to express a great number. 

Much, e levu, and a ka levu. 

Several, e so, e vica beka. 

Few, e lewe lailai, or e le lailai, or e lewe vica ga, of men. E 
lailai, or a ka lailai, e vica beka ga, e vica ga, of things. 

All is used of either number or quantity : Of number, when 
persons are spoken of, o ira kecega, o iratou kecega ; as, o ira na 
tamata kecega, all the men, or ail men : when things are spoken 
of, kece, kecega. Yakaaduaga may be substituted for kecega. 
Of quantity, the same as of number, when spoken of things; viz., 
kece, kecega. Tauco-ko, the whole, entii e. 

The adverbial affix ga, only, is almost invariably joined with 
certain of the numerals (and some other adverbs), and it is usual to 
unite it as an inseparable affix: thus — duaduaga, kecega, vakaa- 
duaga, yaduaga. 

No, none, sa sega, sa segai ; sa sega e dua. 

Some, e so ; as, a tamata e so, some men ; na ka e so, some 
things. E so na tamata, there are some men; e so na ka, there 
are some things. E dua is also used for some, when a part of one 

2-2 



20 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

thing is spoken of; as, mai e dua na wai, bring some water ; me 
dua mai na magimagi, bring some sinnet. 

Any ; this is generally expressed by kecega, all ; e dna, one : 
as, kev.ik.i sa viagunu e dua na tamata, if any man thirst; sa 
lako rawa mai na tamata kecega, any (all) man can corne. 

One : of things, e dua ; of persons, e le (or lewe) dua. 

Other; tani, kadua ; as, o ira na tani, or, o ira na tamata tani, 
other men; lako ki tai kadua, go to the other side of the water, 
or to the other coast ; a ka tani, a different thing. 

Another. When another of the same ~kind is meant, tale is used ; 
when one of a different kind is meant, tani is used ; as me dua tale 
mai na kau, bring another stick or tree ; me kauta mai e dua na 
kau. tani, bring a different kind of tree or stick. 

V. VERBAL OR PARTICIPIAL. 

These have been sufficiently treated of in the different classes 
of adjectives. 

VI. COMPOUND ADJECTIVES. 

There are some classes of words in Fijian which easily com- 
bine, and form adjectives. We shall reckon two classes. 

1. Those compounded of a noun and an adjective. 

(1.) Nouns which postfix the personal pronouns easily combine 
with adjectives. See p. 16. Examples: a tamata yalo-qeleqelea, 
a dirty-souied man; a tamata ya.go-levu, a big-bodied man; a 
tamata yalo-malumalumu, a weak-spirited man, or a humble 
man ; a tamata liga-kaukauwa, a strong-handed man. Perhaps 
they are better written without the hyphen; but it matters but 
little which way. 

(2.) Some nouns which do not postfix the pronouns ; as, a koro 
vale-vinaka, a town having good-houses ; a vanua qele-vinaka, 
a land having good-soil ; a tamata vakaisulu-vinaka, a man 
having good-clothes; a vale sa-vinaka, a house having good- 
rafter?. This class seems to imply possession, or rather being 
possessed, as the compound adjective (a noun and an adjective) 
expresses something that is possessed by the preceding noun ; as 
— a koro possesses vale-vinaka. But this is more or less a feature 
in all kinds of adjectives ; as a good man implies a man that pos- 
sesses goodness. In this latter class of compound adjectives, we 
think that the hyphen ought to be used, 

2. Tnose compounded oi a passive verb and a rtoun. As tauvi 
mate, taken with sickness; tauvi waiwai, soiled with oil; tauvi 
duka, soiled with dirt ; and many others might be compounded 
with tauvi. Tauvi is the passive form of the verb tauva, which 
signifies to touch. Qasivi kalavo, run-upon -by-rats ; tauci uca, 
rained upon ; more literally, fallen upon by the rain ; bau kalou, 
taken away by a god; cila-vi siga, shone upon by the sun; dravui 
sign, turned to ashes (or dust, i. e. burnt up) by the sun ; vono 



ADJECTIVES. 21 

tabua, inlaid with pieces of whale's teeth ; vono civa, inlaid with 
pearl shell ; lau rnoto, wounded with a spear ; lau vatu, wounded 
with a stone ; lau matau, struck witb an axf>. 

It will be seen that this kind of adjectives answers to a passive 
verb followed by a preposition and a noun which express the 
cause, or thing, by which what is said to be done in (or what is 
implied in) the passive verb, is effected. I am taken iviih or by 
death, I am soiled with oil, is the same construction as I am 
smitten by John, I am loved by Jamee. Now, as prepositions in 
Fijian are seldom U3ed as by and with are in English in the 
above construction, when this kind of construction is used in 
Fijian, the noun immediately follows the verb, without the 
intervention of a preposition. We do not mean that this is 
generally the case, but only, that it is so in the above and all 
similar examples. We prefer to write them separately, as tauvi 
mate, not taavimate. 

Such forms as mokubula, mokumate, the passives of the tran- 
sitive verbs mokutavakamatea, moku'avaktbula, may be reckoned 
as compound adjectives, though a little different from those just 
mentioned. 

Inflection of Adjectives. 

Some adjectives of the first class admit of a singular and plural 
form; Mr. Lyth says, "adjectives of size." 

Singular. Plural. 

A tamata levu, a great man A tamata lelevu, great men 

a ka lekaleka, a short thing a ka leleka, short things 

a kau balavu, a long tree or a kau babalavu, long trees or 

stick sticks 

a goLe lailai, a little child a gone lalai, little children. 

In this respect the adjective has the advantage of the noun. 

The other classes, however, do not admit of a plural form. 

Adjectives admit of an intensive form by prefixing dau ; as, a 
tamata dauloloma, a very loving man. But dau here mostly 
means generally, commonly. See under Dau in the Dictionary. 

Degrees of Comparison. 

To adjectives belong different degrees of comparison ; but 
there are no different terminations, or forms, in the Fijian 
adjective itself to express comparison. Comparison must be 
shown either — 

1. By an additional word; as, by cake, above; sobu, below: 
e. g. leva cake, greater — lit. great above; lailai sobu, less — lit. 
little below. Yani is used in much the same way as cake ; as, sa 
levu yani, greater. 

2. By the way in which words are placed in a sentence ; or, in 
other words, by comparing or contrasting things with each other. 



22 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

The positive is frequently used for the comparative; but it is 
readily seen when it i? a positive, and when a comparative, from 
the connection ; as, when several things are spoken of, it is said, 
a cava na ka e vinaka? which is the good thing? The answer is, 
sa vinaka o qo (or ko ya), this (or that) is good — i. e. the better 
one, or the best. This is perhaps the more general way of 
expressing the comparative and superlative degrees in Fijian, 
arid is sufficiently definite. 

There are other forms ; as, sa vinaka duaduaga o qo, this alone 
is good — i. e. this is the best. The prepositions vei before the 
personal pronouns, and e before common nouns, are also used in 
forming comparisons; as, o cei sa qase vei rau ? who is the older 
of the two ? lit. who is old to the two ? sa levu na ka o qo e na 
ka ko ya, this thing is greater than that. But this last is a much 
less common form. 

Another mode of forming comparison is, by a verb capable of 
expressing increase, as uasivi ; as, a turaga levu ko Solomoni, ia 
ka sa uasivi vei koya ko Jisu, Solomon was a great king, but 
Jesus surpassed him, or was greater than he, ni'u sa uasivi sobu 
vei ira keceganai Apositolo, for I am the least ol the Apostles. But 
when another quality than greatness has to be expressed, then 
ithat quality must be stated ; as, sa uasivi vei koya e na vuku ; he 
excels him m wisdom — in other words, he is wiser than he. 

" In any of these methods by means of adverbs the Fijian 
language possesses capabilities of expressing comparison with 
the greatest exactness, and in the most expressive manner. It 
will be seen how far these remarks apply to the comparison of 
adjectives, and how far to the general subject of comparison. 

"In expressing comparison, whether by means of aojectives, or 
otherwise, the following adverbs are often employed; viz., cake, 
denoting more, or in a higher degree; sobu, less, or in a lower 
degree ; vakalevu, in a great degree ; vakalailai, in a small degree ; 
vakalevu cake, in a greater degree; vakalailai sobu, in a less 
degree ; vakalevu sara, very much indeed ; vakalailai sara, in the 
lowest degree.'' — Rev. R. B. Lyth. 

Other forms, as adjectives, adverbs, and emphatic phrases, have 
been given as forming comparisons; but they make nothing 
more tuan emphatic positives, and can only make comparisons in 
the same manner as the positives given above. 

IV. PRONOUNS. 

The pronouns form a very large class of words in Fijian, when 
compared with the same class in most languages. 

The pronouns may be divided into six classes — Personal, Pos- 
sessive, Relative, Interrogative, Reflective, and Demonstrative. 

I. THE PERSONAL PRONOUNS. 

These, as also the possessive pronouns which are formed from 



PRONOUNS. 23 

them, have the peculiarity of expressing in different forms what 
are called the inclusive and exclusive senses. But this, from the 
nature of the case, can only apply to the dual, triad, and plural 
numbers, and only to those in the first persons. For I cannot 
exclude you, nor include myself in ko iko, thou ; koi kemudou, 
you: neither can I include either myself or you in ko ira, they. 
The inchisire and exclusive forms, then, can only be formed in the 
first person ; and as I cannot include you in au, I, it can only be 
found in the dual, triad, and plural numbers. 

Numbers. 

There are undoubtedly four numbers in the Fijian pronouns. 
Why there should be reckoned but three is difficult to say, unless 
for the unsatisfactory reason that three only are known in other 
languages. If it be said that the third number, oi kemudou, 
iratou, etc., is indefinite, and therefore ought not to be reckoned 
a distinct number, this would equally conclude against the plural 
being called a number, for the plural is indefinite enough. 
ira in Fijian, or they in English, may either refer to ten or ten 
thousand. 

But the reckoning four numbers, as there really are. appears to 
simplify them, and renders their acquisition more easy and 
natural. We therefore arrange them in the following manner. 
See Table at the end, II. 

Yua and kaya are compound personal pronouns. Yua is syn. 
with vei koya, to him, and kaya with kei koya, with him. Yua 
and kaya are short and very useful pronouns, and almost super- 
sede the use of vei koya and kei koya. Yua is used only with 
reference to persons, but kaya sometimes is used of things; as, ai 
titoko sa lako voli kaya; or, sa lako voli kaya naiiitoko; he goes 
about with a walking stick. 

REMARKS on the personal pronouns. 

On the formation of the dual and triad numbers, and of pro- 
nouns in the inclusive and exclusive senses. 

1. The characteristic of the dual number is the termination 
r«, or ran, which is a contraction, or corruption, of the numeral 
rua, two. 

2. The characteristic of the third number is the termination 
ton (of the first and third persons), or dou (of the second person), 
a contraction of the numeral tolu, three: which is still re- 
tained unaltered in the Tongan, as akimoutolu; which indeed 
is the plural in that language, there being no other form of the 
plural in it, as there is in the Fijian. 

But though we have given three as the sense of the third num- 
ber, as being the more literal, and strictly correct, yet it is often 
used to express a small number, or a few, without reference to 



24 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

any definite number. The fourth or plural number generally ex- 
presses a greater number. 

3. The characteristics of the fourth or plural number are the 
terminations da, mi, ni, ra, dra ; da of inclu. mi of exclu. of first 
person ; ni (or nu) of second person ; ra (or dra) of third 
person. 

4. Again, the initial 'particle hti is the invariable characteristic 
of the exclusive personal, and nei of the possessive, pronouns. 

The observance of these characteristics will greatly assist the 
memory. 

On the article JcoL 

5. The k may be omitted at the beginning of a sentence, as 
observed under the articles; and the final i may be used or 
omitted at will, except before the first person singular, where 
koi or oi only is used, as koi au, not ko au ; and before the second 
and third person sing, and third pers. plural, where ko or o only 
is used, as ko iko, ko iratou, ko ira. 

On the different nominatives. 

6. The article koi, or ko, is used before the pronouns in the 
following cases : 

(1.) When the pronoun stands alone, or is neither the nom. nor 
obj. case of a verb; as in answering a question; as, o cei ; koi 
au ; who is it ? I. 

(2.) When it is a vocative ease; as, o iko, mo lako mai; you, 
come here. 

(3.) When the nominative follows the verb; as, sa lako koi au ; 
I go. But this does not appear to be a very elegant form of 
speech. 

(4 ) When it is used similarly to what is called the nominative 
absolute in the Hebrew ; as, koi au, au sa lako ; koi keda, eda sa 
lako ; koi kemudou, dou sa lako ; as for me, I go ; as for us, we 
go; as for you, you go. 

(5.) When the proper nominative precedes the verb (that is, 
the pronoun without the article), and the pronoun with the article 
following it, it appears nearly to answer to our reflective pro- 
nouns; aF ? au sa lako koi au, I go myself. 

7. The second of the nominatives, i. e. the pro. without the 
article, is the proper and perhaps the only proper nominative to 
the verb; as, au sa lako. Such modes of speaking, as koi au sa 
kko are evidently elliptical, the full and proper form being, koi 
au ; au sa lako. 

8. There is an exception to the above in the third per. sing. 
ko koya. Koya is never used as the nom. before the verb, but 
ko koya is invariably used after it instead ; as, koya sa lako is 
not spoken, but always sa lako ko koya. The third and shortest 
forms given as nominatives are used chiefly or solely before the 
imperative and infinitive moods oi* the veib, and are therefore as 



PRONOUNS. 25 

Sroperly, or more properly, vocative eases ; as, me da lako, or 
a lako, let us go ; me rau lako, let them two go ; me darn lako, 
or daru lako, let us two go ; sa kaya ko koya me ra lako, he say a 
that they are to go. 

On the possessive cases. 

9. The forms here given cannoi be interchanged with the pos- 
sessive pronoun, and therefore they appeared to be more properly 
considered as possessive eases of the personal pronoun. 

10. Though they cannot be interchanged with, the possessive 
pronouns, the two forms given here may generally be inter- 
changed with each other where there are two forms. Examples : 
a tama i koya, or, a tamana; a tama i keda, or, a tamada ; a 
tama i ratou, or, a tamadratou. But the short or postfixed form 
is the more generally used, and preferable; and indeed is probably 
the only form in some dialects. 

11. The obj. cases require no particular remark. They are used 
after transitive verbs and prepositions ; as, sa. yaviti au ko koya, 
he smites me; sa lako vei ira ko koya, he goes to them. 

II. POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS. 

The personal pronouns being well attended to, the possessive 
pronouns, though equally numerous, will be easily acquired. 

We shall follow the same arrangement as that adopted in the 
personal pronouns. See Table at the end, III. 

REMARKS ON THE POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS. 

1. We have given only the nominative case, as they are declined 
like common nouns ; viz. by ni, poss. case ; na, obj. case; e. g. a 
nona, ni nona, na nona. But when they follow the class of nouns 
which postfix the pronouns (see p. 16), i instead of ni is sometimes 
used as their possessive sign, as, a Tama i noda Turaga ko Jisu 
Karisito, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. But ni is more 
generally used. 

2. It will be seen above that they are of the common gender. 
Nona, his, or hers. But the neuter gender is more commonly 
expressed in the Bau dialect, by kena, kedrau, kedratou, kedra, 
than by nona, nodrau, nodratou, nodra; e. g. a kena (not nona) 
lalaga, its walls, viz. of a house; a kena bai na were, its fence, 
viz. of a garden ; a kedra (not nodra) mate na kau, the disease of 
trees, lit. their disease the trees. 

3. For the different senses of the classes which in general 
imply meats and drinks, and for their formation and derivation, 
see Remarks on the possessive signs, p. 16. And for the character- 
istics of the different numbers and of the exclusive sense, see

III. RELATIVE PRONOUNS. 

There are no relative pronouns in the Fijian any farther than 
the 'personal and demonstrative pronouns are used as such. This 
appears to be a great defect in the language to a learner, who is 
frequently puzzled for want of them, and generally makes mis- 
takes in trying to force the language to do what it will not. The 
want of relative pronouns to show the proper connection of words 
and ideas in speech, constitutes one of the real difficulties of the 
language. 

1. The personal pronouns are used as relatives. A cava ena 
cakava ko koya vei ira era cati koya ? what will he do to them who 
hate him ? lit. to them they hate him. Au sa lomani ira era sa 
lomani au, I love them who love me : lit. them they love me. Au 
na dokai ira era dokai au, I will honour them who honour me. 
But we cannot repeat the third person singular thus; as we 
eannot say au sa lomani koya, o koya sa lomani au. But after a 
noun it may be so used, as, O Jisu, o koya sa vakabulai keda mai 
na cudru ena muri mai, Jesus who saveth us from the wrath to 
come. " Dou ia nai valavala e sa kilikili kei ira sa nona vua 
na Kalou, o koya sa kacivi kemudou ki na nona matanitu kei na 
vanua vakaiukuuku." 1 Ces. ii. 12. " koya ka lako voli ka 
daucaka vinaka," who went about doing good. See three exam- 
ples, 1 Joni i. 1. O koya may refer to a thing, as well as a 
person ; as, ai tukutuku, o koya ka'u a mai tukiina ; the report 
which I came to tell. See another ex., Cakacaka x. 37. It 
appears to be sometimes used in the plural when things are 
referred to, as era is very rarely used except of persons. See 
Rom. vi. 21. 

2. The possessive pronouns are also used as relatives ; viz , for 
whose. Examples : O cei sa turaga mai Viwa ? O Namose- 
malua ga ; a norui vosa ka'u sa qai kauta mai ? Who is the 
chief ot Vewa ? Namosemalua ; whose command I have now 
brought ; lit. his. " Sa nodra ko ira na qase : " " whose are the 
fathers : " Rom. ix. 5 : lit. theirs. 

3. The demonstrative pronouns are used as relatives. O ya, 
a ya, o qo, o qori, are used as relatives in the same way as the 
personal pronouns 

4. The compound pro. vua, to him, used for to whom, is used as 
a relative pronoun. As, a tamata ka'u a vosa vua me tara na 
noqu vale; the man to whom I spake to build my house. But 
vua might properly come under tue personal pronouns used as 
relatives. As also might, 

5. The compound pronoun kaya, when used as a relative pro- 
noun. A tamata keirau sa tiko kaya, the man with whom I 
dwell. A waqa keitou a lako kaya, tne canoe along with which 
we came. 

6. Kina is used instead of a relative pronoun. It may refer 
either to persons or things. Examples : A tamata ka'u a vosa 



PRONOUNS. 



27 



kina, the man to (or of) whom I spake; a ka ka'u a vosa kina, the 
thing of which I spake. It may be used for to whom, by whom, for 
whom, in whom ; to which, by which, for which, in which, with which; 
as, a waqa ka'u a lako rriai kina, the canoe in which I came ; ai sau 
ka'u a cakava kina na noqu were, the stick (spade) with which I 
did my garden; a vale ka'u sa tiko kina, the house in which I 
dwell ; a ka ko ya ka'u a lako kina ; that is the thing for (or 
on account of) wlvch I went ; a uvi na ka sa dauvoli kina na kuro, 
yams are the things with which pots are generally bought. 

IV. INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS. 

There are two interrogative pronouns in the Fijian, ko or o 
cei, who, of persons; and a cava, what, of things. They, like the 
English who, and what, are of both genders and numbers, as, o 
cei ko koya ? who is he or she ? o cei ko ira ? who are they ? in the 
masculine and feminine genders. A cava na ka o qo ? what is this ? 
or, what are these ? 

From the senses of cei and cava, the former referring to persons, 
and the latter to things, cei would naturally be declined like a 
"proper, and cava like a common, noun. 

Declension of Ko cei. 

Nom. Ko or o cei ? who ? 
Poss. i cei 

a nei cei ? 

a kei cei ? 

a m^i cei ? _, 
Obj. cei? whom? 



whose ? 



Declension of A cava. 

Nom . A cava ? what ? 
Poss. ni cava ? of what ? 
Obj. na cava ? what ? 

O cei is used, 1. when asking about a person ; as, cei ko 
Bativonu ? who is Bativonu ? o cei na tamata ? who is the man ? 
2, when asking the name of a person ; as, o cei na yacana ? who is 
his name ? 3, when asking about the name of a country ; as, o cei na 
vanua ? who is the country, or ^>nd ? It seems to be used in the 
latter two cases instead of cava, because the answer to the question 
will always be a proper name, as well as in the former. 

O cei, and cava, like the Heb. interrog itives mi and ma, are 
sometimes used in a sense not strictly interrogatory, but in a sense 
of doubt ; e. g. au sa sega ni kila se ko ceisa lako, I do not know 
who is gone — lit. I do not know or who is gone. Au sa sega ni 
kila se cava na ka e lako kina, I do not know what he has gone for. 

A cava is also used as a sort of interjection, or interrogative of 



28 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

surprise; as, A cava era sa tama kina na tamata o qori ? why do 
those men use the shout of respect ? a cava, sa tiko kina ko tui 
Viti ! why, is not the king of Fiji there? or, as though you did 
not know that the king of Fiji was there. 

V. REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS. 

Reflectives in English are formed by adding self, or selves, to 
other pronouns ; thus, myself, thyself, himself. Own also gives the 
pronouns a reflective sense, but is not united to the pronoun as 
self is ; as« his own, their own. 

The forms in Fijian which appear to answer to reflexive pro- 
nouns are the personal pronouns preceded by their article ; as au 
sa lako koi au, I go myself ; o sa lako ko iko, se sega ? do you go 
yourself or not ? But when the verb is active, and the action re- 
jected upon one's self, simply the obj. c. of the persoral pro. is 
used; as, au sa yaviti au, I strike myself; koi au, ko iko, ko 
koye, etc., are either I, thou, he ; or myself, thyself, himself. 

VI. DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS. 

The simple demonstrative pronoun o qo, and o qori, this and 
that, are without distinction of gender or number. But the 
compound demonstratives admit of different numbers. As — 

This, these. That, those. 

O qo, sing, or pL o qori, sing, or pi. 

o koya o qo, sing. o koya o qori, sing, 

o ira o qo, pi. o ira o qori, pi. 

o ya, generally sing. 

o koya koya, sing. 

Remarks. — The article o may be used with the k, as ko koya, 
except before qo and qori, which take o only. Ya in some cases 
takes the article o, in others a ; but it is difficult to say when 
it should take one and when the other. Perhaps it should take 
o when a person is referred to, and a when a thing; but 
the subject will bear further investigation. A yais more generally 
a relative than a demonstrative pronoun. 

The demonstrative pronouns, contrary to the usage of the 
personals, and common nouns, retain their article when preceded 
by vaka ; as vakaikoya, per. pro.; vykatamata, com. n. ; vakakoya, 
vakaoqo, dem. pro. But the common nouns can also be used with 
their article ; as, vaka na tamata. 

Y. VERBS. 

I. ON THE DERIVATION OF VERBS. 

The simple form of verbs, or root, appears never to consist 
of more than two syllables, and a vast number of but one. 



VERBS. 29 

1. Most of the verbs appear to be primitive, or underived 
words; as, lako, to go ; tiko, to sit; vosa, to speak. 

2. Some are derived from nouns ; as, bukana, to add fuel ; from 
buka, fuel ; rubuna, to put into a box, from rubu, a box ; katuma, 
to fathom, from katu, a fathom ; tagana, to take with a taga, 
or .small net, used in fishing; qelena, sauna, saulokina, olona, 
qalina, lagona, dabana, bacana, and many others, are similarly 
formed from nouns, viz. by adding na to the noun. 

3. Some are formed from adjectives. 1. Some without the 
causative vaka, as cata, to hate, from ca, bad ; cataka, to make 
bad, spoil; vinakata, to like, from vinaka, good; dinata, to 
believe, from dina, true. 2. But most adjectives can become 
verbs by prefixing vaka, and affixing taka, as, vakaloaloataka, to 
blacken, from loaloa, black ; vakacacana, and vakacataka, to make 
bad, from ca, bad ; vakabalavutaka, to lengthen, from balavu, 
long. 3. Some without the terminating taka; as, vakacala, 
to cause to err, from cala, wrong ; vakalialia, to make foolish, to 
befool, from lialia, foolish. 4. Compound adjectives may be 
changed into verbs ; as, vakayagokaukauwataka, to cause to have 
a strong body, from yagokaukauwa, having a strong body; 
vakayalovinakataka, to cause to be of a good mind, to appease, 
from yalovinaka, good-natured. 

4 Some few are formed from adverbs, as from sobu, down, 
is formed sobuca, to go down, vakasobuta, to put down ; caketa, 
to take up, from cake, up. 

II. ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF VERBS. 

The Fijian verbs admit of many different modes of classi- 
fication, from the many different ways in which they are formed, 
and the different senses in which they are used. In this respect 
they bear little or no analogy to European languages ; and a 
proper arrangement is as important as it is difficult. The 
importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse for the 
abundance of the Examples which are generally given under 
each rule. 

The distinctions into Intransitive, Transitive, and Passive, 
are much more prominent and important in Fijian than in 
English, on account of the variety of forms assumed by the 
Fijian verb to express these distinctions. Other distinctions 
or classes will be considered under the head of prefixes, such as, 
Intensives, Causatives, Reciprocals, and Beciprocal-Causatives ; 
all which classes have distinct forms (from the use of the pre- 
fixes), as well as dis ! inct senses in the Fijian verbs. 

We shall first consider the distinctions of Intransitives, 
Transitives, and Passives. 



30 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

1. Intransitives . 

Intransitives " are those in which the thing (action) expressed 
is confined to the actor, and does not pass on to an object. They 
include the class usually termed neuter verbs, as well as those 
which, though active, are intransitive : " as, active- in transitive, — 

Au sa cakacaka, I work ; 
au sa kerekere, I beg ; 
o sa volavola, you write ; 
era sa vavavi, they bake. 
Here action is implied, but without an object affected by it. 

Neuter-intransitives — 
Au sa moce, I sleep ; 
au sa koto, I lie ; 
o sa tiko, you sit ; 
era sa tu, they stand. 

Here existence, and a certain state of existence, is implied, but 
no action. 

These distinctions, though they exist in the English, and 
other larjgaages, are comparatively unimportant, because a verb 
has the same form when it has an active-intransitive sense as when 
it has an active-transitive one : e. g. the verb to work has the same 
form in English, when used either in an active-intransitive or 
an active-transitive sense. And but very few neuter -intransitives 
can ever be used in a transitive sense at all ; as we cannot say I 
lie it, I sit it, I sleep it. But the contrary of this is the case with 
the Fijian verb; for active- intransitives assume a different 
form on taking an active-transitive sense, as cakacaka becomes 
cakava, and all neuter -intransitives can become active -tr an sitives 
on assuming a transitive termination ; as, mocera, to sleep upon ; 

kotora, to lie upon ; 
tikora , to sit upon ; 
tura, to stand upon. 

N.B. These words do not bear these senses in some dialects, 
but the principle here given exists in all the dialects with which 
we are acquainted. 

It will be seen from the above that when a neuter-intransitive 
becomes an active- transitive it then answers to a neuter verb 
followed by a -preposition, in English : the transitive termination 
in such a case exactly answering to a preposition. It may 
answer to almost any preposition, according as the sense of the 
verb or its object requires, as, in, on, upon, for, to, from, about, 
over, across, etc. Examples : — 

Au sa lakova na sala o qo, I go in this walk; 

au a butuka na gata, I trod on a snake; 

era sa v odoka na waqa, they went on board ; 



VERBS. 31 

eratou a lakova na tamata ko ya, they went for that man ; 

sa salava na vale na wa, the running- weed runs up to, or upon, 
the house ; 

o sa drotaki cei ? from whom do you flee ? 

sa drotaka nai sele na butako, the thief ran away with the 
knife; 

a cava dou sa vosataka? what are you speaking about ? 

cicitaka nai vola o qo, run with this letter ; 

qalova na wai o qo, swim across or over this water; 

kabata na kau koya, climb up that tree ; 

kabataka na matau o qo, climb up with this axe. 

Remarks— 1. From the above examples it will appear that a 
transitive termination when affixed to a neuter-intransitive vmb 
may answer to any preposition which its verb, or the object of the 
verb, requires. 

2. Though neuter-intransitives can become active transitives, 
as seen above, yet they cannot become active-intransitives ; as 
tiko, moce, etc., cannot be active. See page 30. 

3. Neuter-intransitives are simple words or roots ; as, tiko, tu, 
no, koto, bula, toka, ro. But — 

4. Active-intrans r dives are rarely so. They are mostly a redu- 
plicated, or partly -reduplicated, form of the root, as those given 
above, and many to be presently given, will show. 

2. Transitives. 

Transitive, or active verbs, are those in which the action 
expressed by the verb passes on to, or affects, some object ; as, au 
sa lomani koya, I love him ; eratou a kauta na waqa, they took the 
canoe. 

The object of a transitive verb must be expressed or clearly 
understood. In fact it must be somewhere expressed in a speech, 
otherwise the speech will be unintelligible ; but being once ex- 
pressed it is seldom repeated in the same speech by good native 
speakers, how frequently soever the transitive form of the same, 
or of other verbs referring to it, may recur. The observance of 
this rule is very important to the understanding of a native 
discourse, in order to keep in the object to which the verbs refer. 

There are two kinds of transitive verbs in Fijian which are 
clearly distinct both in their senses and forms. This is a pecu- 
liarity, and a beautiful one too, of the Fijian language. We 
shall call them Indefinite, and Definite, Transitives, as these words 
seem to express their different uses very appositely. 

The Indefinite- Transitives. 

These are the shortest form of the verb, or the simple root; 
which is immediately followed by the noun which is its object. 
It does not admit of an article or any other word to intervene 
between it and the noun which it takes as its object. And it 
expresses an action in a general and indefinite manner. It how- 



32 FIJIAN C4RAMMAR. 

ever postfixes the particle i, when used before the nouns which 
are always preceded by i; as, cakai sele; taui bulubulu; kaui 
vakacavacava ; tuvai wau ; tuvai valu ; etc. The i is not generally 
written in such cases when the verb terminates in i ; as wiii vola, 
voli sele, voli sulu; but though not written it is heard in the 
lengthened sound of the final i ; and we are not persuaded that 
it would not be more proper to write it also in such cases ; as, 
volii sulu, wilii vola, etc 

When the verb takes ya as its definite-transitive termination, 
the indefinite-transitive will be i, and therefore apparently the 
simplest form of the verb, as — def. tr. : roro-ya, ro-ya, donu-ya ; 
indef. tr. : roi, roi, donui. 

Examples: 

Me caka were, lit. to work garden; 
me tar a vale ,, to build house ; 
me wili vola, „ to read book ; 
me vau waqa, „ to fasten canoe ; 
me vavi vuaka, „ to bake pig ; 
me voli ka „ to buy things. 

When any word or words occur to render the object definite, 
the indefinite form is thus dropped, and the definite -transitive 
form used, which is now to be considered. 

Definite- Transitives. 

The definite-transitive verbs require a definite object after them, 
which must always, when a common noun, be preceded by an 
article. 

Another very important difference between the indefinite and 
definite-transitives is, that they have different forms ; the latter, 
as a general rule, affixing one, two, or three syllables to the simple 
or indefinite- transitive form of the verb. These affixes, or verbal 
terminations, we shall now consider. 

The Definite- Transitive Terminations. 

We shall arrange them in two classes : — 

1. Those which, consist of one syllable. These are, -a, -ca, -ga, 
-ka, -ma, -na, -ra, -ta, -va, -wa, and -ya. 

2. Those which consist of two syllables. These are, -caka, 
-kaka, -laka, -maka, -raka, -taka, -vaka, -waka, -yaka. 

Remarks. 1. The terminations of the first class of the most 
common occurrence are, -a, -ca, -ka, -na, -ta, -va, and -ya : and of 
the second, -taka, -vaka, and -raka. The terminations -kaka, 
-wa, -waka, but seldom occur. 

2. There appears to be no certain rule to determine which 
termination a verb will take. This must be learned from the 
natives, or from the Dictionary. 

3. But notwithstanding that there is no invariable rule, yet we 



VERBS. 33 

are persuaded that they are not always used arbitrarily. And we 
are disposed to think that there is a general shade of difference in 
the native mind between the two classes of terminations given 
above. That they are not all used arbitrarily in all cases will 
sufficiently appear from the following: considerations : (1.) It 
peems to amount to a rule, that verbs formed from nouns without 
prefixing valza, shall take na for their termination. See examples 
page 29. To which taubena, tekivuna, tabana, tekina, logana, 
solena, and others might be added. The na here may be the 
third per. pro. ; and rubuna would mean to box it — i. e. to put it 
into a box : and so of the rest. It rarely, if ever, happens that 
any other class of verbs takes this termination. (2.) It appears 
also to be a rule, that verbs of 'motion will take va for their ter- 
mination ; as, lakova, ciciva, kadava, drodrova, titiva, teteva, 
salava, darava, driva, dolova, qasiva, qarava, sisiva, taduva, karava, 
qalova, taleva, tarava, yalova, yacova, etc. Ya here means to. It 
is also true that many other verbs besides those of motion take 
va, but for these perhaps there is no rule. (3.) When verbs 
reject a termination of the first or monosyllabic class, and take 
one of the second, or dissyllabic, they frequently have either a 
more intensive sense, or take a different object. The terminations 
-laka and -raka especially are rarely used except in an intensive 
sense. 

Examples: Basuka, basuraka; butuka, buturaka ; drutia, 
drutilaka; sakoca, sakolaka; vesoka, vesolaka; varota, varolaka, 
and many others. 

We shall now give examples of verbs whose different termina- 
tions affect different objects; or the same object in a diffeient 
manner : 

Sokota na vanua, to sail to land, sokot ika na waqa, sail the 

canoe, 
karava na vanua, to pole to land, karavaka na waqa, pole the 

canoe along; 
qdova na waqa, to swim to a qalovaka na ka ki waqa, to 
canoe, swim with this thing to 

the canoe ; 
ciciva na ka (run for or to), cicivaka na ka (run with) ; 

kabata na kau, climb the tree. kabataka na matau, to climb 

up with an axe ; 
cabeta na vanua (go up), cabetaka na ka (carry up) ; 

sobuca na vanua (go down), sobutaka na ka (take down) ; 

dromuca na waqa, overwhelm dromucaka na ka, push a 
the canoe, thii-g down under water ; 

vutaka na dalo, to pound dalo, vutulaka nai vutu; 
vosaka na tamata, vosataka na vosa ; 

vekaca na sala, vekacaka na da ; 

rogoca na vosa, rogotaka na (or nai) rogo ; 

tava, taya ; 

yadrata (to awaken), yadrava (to watch for) ; 

virika na tamata, viritaka na vatu ; 



34 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

masuta na tamata, masulaka na tamata ; 

rabota na tamata, rabotaka na vatu ; 

kiciva na tamata, kacivaka na vosa ; 

sorova (to soro to), sorovaka (to soro for); 

vnuauea na tamata, vunautaka na vosa ; 

tukuca, tukuna; 

kelia na qele, kelivaka na dura ; 

vana, na tamata, vanataka na dakai ; 

cudruva, cudruvaka ; 

drova (flee to), drotaka (flee away with) ; 

drodrova, drodroga ; 

vakaleca(claumaka),tobehappy vakalecataka (to cause to be 

in), < happy); 

siwata na ika, siwataka na siwa ; 

taya na kau, tavaka na matau ; 
sauma (to return a good or saumaka (to turn end for end). 

evil), 

The above examples will be sufficient to show that many verba 
take different objects when they take a different termination ; 
or if they affect the same object, it is in a very different manner j 
as, me vanataka na dakai, is to shoot with a gun ; me vana, 
na dakai, to shoot a gun. It is not to be supposed that the nouns 
given above express the only objects which either of the termina- 
tions take. The Dictionary will illustrate this subject more fully. 

4. The final letter of the definite-transitive, which is invariably 
a before a common noun, becomes i before a proper name ; as, sa 
cata na tamata ko Yisawaqa ; but, sa cati Visawaqa ko ira na 
tamata. Also before some nouns of relationship; a*, sa lomani 
tamana ko ka. This principle in reality holds good when i pre- 
cedes the final a, as in solia. The final a is usually omitted 
in writing, as, soli koya ; but as the sound of the i which 
preceded it is lengthened, so as to be equal to two i's, the final a 
is in reality changed into i, in speaking, though not in writing. 
It would be better to write solii koya. 

5. Many verbs ending in a, in the Bau dialect, especially, do 
not take a different termination on becoming definite-transitives; 
but in such cases they invariably remove the accent to the final 
syllable, unless it was there before. As, indef-tr. taravale; def. 
tr. tara na vale. 

6. These verbs which do not take an additional termination on 
becoming definite-transitives, do not change the final a into i 
when they precede proper names [see 4 above], nor when they 
become passives [see page 38], but affix thei to it ; as kila, kilai — 
not kili ; lewa, lewai — not lewi. 

7. Some act. intr. verbs, chiefly those which express the acts of 
the mind, have the force of act. trans, verbs when they take a pre- 
position after them; as, au sa rere ki na Kilou, is the same as au 
sa rerevaka na Kalou. But the latter is the more general, and 
much the preferable form. But verbs generally cannot be used in 



VERBS. 



35 



the former way at all; for we cannot say, au sa teitei ki nakau, 
instead of an sa tea na kau. 

8. Most probably the terminations, as well as the prefixes, wei?e 
originally distinct words, and that in their present use they 
retain more or less of the original senses. Perhaps we still have the 
originals of the terminations : — ca, ga, va (vei), taka, vaka, caka, 
ka, ya. Ca, bad, seems still to retain some of its original sense 
in vekaca, vaca, sauca, beca, dewaca, levaca, lomoca, sabica. Ya 
in the Rewa dia. is still the same as vei or ki, to, which sense it 
more or less bears in many verbs of which it is the transitive 
termination ; as in verbs of motion. See examples page 33. But 
this may be a subject for iurther investigation. It is not of es- 
sential importance. 

We shall now give examples of the forms and uses of the 
Intransitives and Transitives, definite and indefinite, placing the 
simpler forms first.

N.B. Most of these intransitives are used as indefinite-transi- 
tives also, as vakarorogo vunau, and rogo vunau ; vakanananu ka 
and nanu ka seem to be precisely syn., unless the vaka make them 
more intensive. 

Some are irregular, changing their termination in the indef. 
tr. and intr., instead of rejecting it.

But neuter -intransitives, though they can take a definite tran- 
sitive form, do not seem capable of being used as indefinite 
transitives; as,

,, (not koto ka), kotora na ka, koto 

„ (not moce rarawa, mocera na rarawa, moce 

sokota na vanua, soko 

Sokoti cagi seems to be an exception, and also qalo waqa and 
cici cere. 

But when these verbs can take vaka causative prefixed, they 
can be used in an indef. trans, and def. trans, sense, but commonly 
want the intransitive. 

Vakamate vuaka, vakamatea na vuaka, wanting, or ia na veivakamatei- 
vakabale kau, vakabalta na kau, „ ia na veivakabalei. 

vakamoce gone, vakamocera na gone, „ ia na veivakamoceri. 

The following recapitulation of rules (most of which properly 
belong to Syntax) concerning the different manners in which the 
above are used, may not be useless. 

1. That the simple form of the verb is either an indef. tr., or 
passive, or n. intr. : rarely active-transitive. 

2. That the active-intransitive is generally a reduplicated, or 
partly-reduplicated form of the simple word or root. 

3. That the object of the indef .-transitive verb must immediately 
follow the verb, and can never admit of the article na before it, nor 
any other particle ; as it would be improper to say, era sa vakamate 
tiko vuaka. If the article na follows the short form of the verb, 
it is no longer a transitive, but a passive : as, sa caka ka, tr. ; sa 
cakana ka, pass. 

4. That tne definite-transitive always takes the article before 
its object in common nouns, but the object may be before or after, 



VERBS. 37 

near or at a distance : as, 1. Immediately after it;ap, era vakamatea 
na vuaka : 2. At a distance from it ; era vakamatea tiko na nona 
vuaka; era kitaka e na veisiga na ka o qori : 3. Before it ; na 
vuaka ko ya era sa vakamatea; na tamata ka'u sa lomana. 

5. That, as a natural result of the indefinite sense of the short, or 
indef. trans, form, that form cannot t »ke proper names as its 
object, for proper names are always definite; as, we cannot say, 
era caka (or cukai) Ratu Ravisa, but, era cakavi Ratu Ravisa. 

6. That the short form, or indef. trans, may terminate in any 
vowel [see the above examples], but that the definite-transitives 
always terminate iu an a when they precede common nouns and 
possessive pronouns ; and in an i when proper names and personal 
pronouns, as me Crikava na tamata; me cakava nancqu ka; me 
cakavi au ; me cakavi Ratu Mara. 

7. That though the def. trans, alivays requires the article 
na before its object before common nouns, yet it never takes the 
art. Tco before it in propter names ; as, me cakava na tamata, but 
not me cakava ko Ratu Mara. The reason for this is just the same 
as the reason why the indef. trans, cannot take an article before 
its object, viz. because they are both used as passives as well as 
transitives; and they then become passives when the article na or 
ko follows. 

8. That for the same reason also proper nouns must imme- 
diately follow their transitive verb; as, sa cakavi Joni tiko ko 
Tomasa, and not, sa cakavi ko Tomasi Joni, or sa cakavi tiko 
Joni ko Tomasa. 

9. But there is this difference between the senses of the def. 
trans, with its object when a proper name, and the indef. trans. 
with a common name, that in the former the object may precede 
its noun, and then it will always take the article ko, as, ko Jemesa 
ka.'u sa lomana : but in the latter the object cannot precede its 
verb as stated in remark 1. 

Attention to the preceding rules is of the utmost importance to 
the perspicuity of the language, and in fact without the practice 
of them (whether we know them ornot) we could not be understood. 

3. Passives. 

There are several forms of the verb used as passives. We may 
reckon, 

1. The shortest form, or root, of most verbs is used as a passive. 
They have consequently a common form with the indefinite-tran- 
sitives. But though they have a common form, they cannot be 
confounded with each other, for the construction of the sentence 
in which they occur will always show whether the short form of a 
verb is U3ed in an indef. trans, or a passive sense. For, as seen 
above, the indef. trans, must always be immediately followed by 
the noun which is its object. But when the simple form of the 
verb is used in ^passive tense, a noun will never thus follow it, 
but must have an article preceding it. Example — 



FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 



Indef. trans. Pass. 

Sa caka were, sa caka na were; 

sa viri bai, sa viri na bai ; 

sa tei uvi, sa tei na uvi ; 

sa ta kau, sa ta na kau. 

2. Another passive form of the verb is the termination i, 
substituted for the final a, in def. transitives : e. g. 



Def. trans. 

Sa cakava na were, 
sa viritaka na bai, 
sa lakova na tamata, 
sa sokotaka na waqa, 
sa tavaka na matau, 
sa tukuna na vosa, 



Pass. 

sa cakavi na were ; 
sa viritaki na bai ; 
sa lakovi na tamata ; 
sa sokotaki na waqa ; 
sa tavaki na matau ; 
sa tukuni na vosa. 



But verbs which do not take an additional termination on 
becoming def. trans, do not change a into i, but affix it to it ; as, 

Sa kila na ka, sa kilai na ka ; 

sa lewa na ka, sa lewai na ka. 

We have an exception to this in tara, to build, which is tara 
:tiso in the passive ; as, me tara na vale, to build a house, def. 
trans. ; satara (not tarai) na vale, pass. ; the house is built. 

3. Verbs whose transitive termination is -ya, change the ya 
into i ; as, 



Def. trans. 

Roroya (to strengthen), 
soya (to scrape), 
maroroya (to preserve), 
donnya (to approve of), 
tavoya (to wash), 
vaya (to bind in a bundle), 



Pass. 

roroi (strengthened) ; 
soi (scraped) ; 
inaroroi (preserved) ; 
donui (approved of) ; 
tavoi (washed) ; 
vai (bound). 



Sxcept taya. to chop which does not become tai in its passive 
iorm. Also kaya becomes kainakior *kai, and boroya,, boro. 

We would suggest whether those verbs which now have no 
additional termination on becoming def. trans, might not ori- 
ginally have taken ya. They would then come as regulars under 
this third form of passives ; as, 

Kilaya (know), kilai (known) ; 

lewaya (judge), lewai (judged). 

We shall now give a few examples to show the difference 
between the indef. trans, and passive, and the def. trans, and 
passive. 



Indef. trans. 
Sa caka vale, 
(build house), 



Pass. 
sa caka na vale, 
(house is built), 



Def trans. 
sa cakava na vale, 
(ouild a house), 



Pasi. 
sa cakavi na vale, 
(the house is built).

Remarks. — 1. It is very difficult to ascertain the shade of 
difference, in sense, which exists between these two forms of the 
passive verb, and yet we have no doubt that there is in some 
cases a difference, and that they are not always, though they are 
commonly, interchangeable. We have been disposed to think 
that they vary like the transitives, viz., that the short form of 
the passive (as caka) is more indefinite, and the long form (as 
cakavi) is definite. But we are not satisfied upon the subject. 
Future investigation may make it clearer. 

2. All verbs do not admit of two passive forms in this way. 
Those verbs seldom do which form their passives by prefixes ; 
which forms we shall now consider. 

3. The passives of some verbs are formed by prefixes, or by 
the passive form of 6ome other verb ; as, by lau, ha, ra, ta, and 
perhaps some other particles. They are all prefixed to the short 
passive form of the verb. 

Lau. This is the short passive form of lauta, to pierce, to 
hurt, strike, injure, or wound, and is prefixed to the short pas- 
sive form of most verbs which convey any idea of injuring ; as, 
Def. trans. Pass. 

Seleva, to cut, lausele, cut ; 

coka, to pierce, laucoka, pierced ; 

taya, to chop, lauta, chopped. 

See this word with other examples in the Dictionary. 
Ka. Examples : 

kalove, bent; 
kavoro, broken ; 
k ate be, broken; 
kadresu ; 



Loveca, to bend, 
vorota, to break, 
febeka, to break, 
dresuka, 

Ra. 

Musuka, to break, 
guiuva, to cut off, 

Ta. 

Dolava, to open, 
cavuta, to pull up, 
sova, to pour, 



Examples : 

ramusu, broken ; 
ragutu, cut off; 

Examples : 

tadola, open; 
tacavu, pulled up ; 
tasova, spilt. 



Passives formed in this way are used— 1. When the person is 



40 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

unknown by whom the thing was done ; or, 2. When it is not 
desirable to mention him ; or, 3. When the thing has come into 
that state of itself; as, sa tasere na waqa, the canoe has got 
adrift, of itself. Sa sereki (another pass, form of sereki) na waqi 
would imply that some one had set it adrift.. 

These may be called impersonal passive forms, p. s they are never 
used except in the third person singular; as, it is done. Tava, 
and perhaps a few others, have the same form both in. the def. and 
passive senses. 

III. VERBAL PREFIXES. 

We have already mentioned the prefixes ha, ra, and fa, which 
imply a, passive sense. The following prefixes are of much more 
extensive use, and of far greater importance. They are dau, vaJca, 
and vei. 

Dau gives an intensive, or frequentative sense to words to which 
it is prefixed, and when prefixed to verbs they may be called inten- 
sive verbs. Vaka generally gives a causative sense to the words 
to which it is prefixed ; and vei gives a reciprocal sense to the 
verb, which may therefore be called reciprocal verbs. 

Dau. 

Dau, as a prefix to verbs, has the sense of intensity, frequency, 
or continuance, but more frequently of the two latter. With very 
mar.y verbs it cannot have an intensive, but only a frequentative 
sense; as in dautii, dautiko, daukoto, daulutu, dausoko, daumoce, 
etc. In such cas p s its sense must be rendered by such adverbs as 
generally, frequently, habitually, commonly , always^ etc. With 
many vtrbs it may have either a frequentative or intensive sense ; 
as, a tamata daulako may either mean, a man who is frequently 
going, or a man who goes swiftly, but it would more generally 
have the latter signification; as, a tamata daucakacaka, a man 
always at work; rarely a man who works quickly ; this would be 
expressed by a tamata gumatua e na cakacaka. Dazt is prefixed 
to verbs of all kinds, def. and indef. transitive*, cautatives (com- 
mencing with vakn), reciprocals (beginning with vei), and recip- 
r< cal-causatives (beginning with veivaka), but it has substantially 
the same sense in all cises. 

Examples : Me daukaci, to call frequently; me daucakava na 
ka, to do a thing frequently (not quickly) ; me dauvakdbula, to 
save or cause to live frequently; me dauveiraici, to see each other 
frequently ; me dauveivakacudrui, to cause each other to be angry 
frequently; me dauveicudruvuki, to avenge each other's wrongs 
frequently. Hence, when united with a verb, the word will express 
both the agent or subject, and the action ; as, daubutako, one who 
frequently steals, a thief; a dauvere, one who frequently tempts, 
a tempter ; a dauveivakarusai, one who frequently destroys, a 
destroyer. 

For ihe sense of dau when it precedes adjectives and nouns, see 



VERBS. 41 

the Dictionary under Dan. Dan should be united with adjectives 
find verba, but not with nouns, as it does nob influence the noon, 
but some verb understood. 

Vaka. 

Yaka is prefixed to nouns, adjectives, and verbs, and generally 
implies either similitude, or causation. But. probably, similitude 
is its original idea, even when it is a causative ; as, ca, bad ; va- 
kaca, ad., badly, or bad-like; vakacataka, to make a thins: bad; 
probably the primitive idea is to like-bad-it, to make it like ca, 
bad. Balavu, long; vakabalavutaka, to lengthen, cause to be long 
— lit. like-long-it, to make it like balavu, long. 

1. Yaka changes nouns into verbs which signify to cause a thing 
to have possession of what is expressed in the noun; as, vakadia- 
taka, to put a handle into a thing — lit. to put it in possession of a 
handle ; vakawaqa^aka, to put a waqa, or cover, on a thing, or to 
put it into possession of a waqa. 

2. It changes adjectives into verbs by causing the thing to be 
what is expressed by the adjective ; as, 6a, bad ; vakacaoana, or 
vakacacataka, to cause to be bad, to spoil; balavu, long ; vaka- 
balavutakfi, to cause to be long. 

3. It changes neuter-intransitive verbs into active-transitive 
ones, by making them causative; as, bula, to live; vakibua, to 
cause to live, to save; mate, to die; vakamatsa, to cause to die, 
to kill. 

4 It changes some two or three passive verbs in the same 
manner ; as, sucu, to be born ; vakasucuma, to cause to be born, 
or bring forth ; rogo, to be heard : vakarogotaka, to cause to be 
heard, i.e. to report. But these are exceptions. It does not 
change passes which are x also active-intransitives as well as 
passives ; nor yet passives formed by changing the transitive 
termination a into i ; e. g. biu, caka, cola, etc., are passives, and 
the simple roots, but they are intr. as well as passive, and we 
cannot say vakabiutaka, vakacakataka, vakacolataka. Again, 
biuti, cakavi, colati, etc., are also passives formed by changingthe 
tr. termination a, into i ; but we cannot say vakabiucitaka, vaka- 
cakavitaka, vakacolatitaka; so that the above appear to be excep- 
tions. The following remark en the Heb. jausative form Hiphil by 
Dr. Lee, is also applicable to the Fijian causative, — " Another 
property is, exhibiting, declaring, or esteeming the person or thing 
designated by such word as possessed of the quality intimated by 
the primitive." The applicability of this principle to such words 
as the following cannot be doubted, vakacaoana, lit. to mtke bad : 
i.e. to declare to be so; to slander; vaki:siaa, lit. to mike one a 
kaisi ; i.e. to treat or represent one as such; vakalialia ; vakase- 
wasewana, lit. to make a person a fool ; i.e. to treat or represent 
him as such; also vakacala, to convict of guilt, criminate; 
vakadonuya,to represent or speak of one as just, to approve of. 



42 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

5. It is sometimes, though seldom, prefixed to active-tran- 
sitive verbs, but never makes them causative : as vakacakava, to 
cause to do ; vakacolata, to cause to carry, etc. Causatives of 
this kind are not used in Fijian, as neither are their passives, 
vakacakavitaka, to cause to be made ; neither is the Hiphil, the 
causative form in the Hebrew, so used. It is frequently difficult 
to define the exact difference in sense between an active- transi- 
tive veib when used without the vaka and the same verb with it, 
though it is evident that a difference generally, if not always, 
doe6 exist; as raica; to look ; vakaraica, to look after, oversee; 
tala, to send; vakatala, to send off; vakavota seems to signify to 
vota hastily. Its general aspect in such cases appears to be 
intensity. 

For other uses of this important particle see on Derivation and 
Classes of Adjectives, paragraph (4.) p. 17, and Proper Adjectives, 
p. 18 : and Adverbs, p. 50, par. 1 ; and especially the Dictionary 
under this word, where all its various uses are treated of together. 

Vei. 

We have already seen the use of this particle as a prefix 
to nouns. (See p. 10, par. 2.) In such a situation it has aplural 
sent*, and this sente is probably more or less retained when it is 
prefixed to verbs. Its most prominent aspect when prefixed to 
verbs is reciprocity ; but it is evident that reciprocity implies 
plurality, tor there cannot be a reciprocal action where there are 
not two or more actors, or objects. It probably therefore retains 
more or less of its primitive sense of plurality when prefixed 
to verbs as well as nouns. 

Vei prefixed to verbs implies, 1. Reciprocity; as, veilomani, to 
love one anothor ; veicati, to hate one. another : 2. With verbs of 
motion it frequently implies to go and come, or backwards and 
forwards, which does not imply reciprocal motion ; as, veilako- 
yaki, veisokoy aki. J3. It sometimes implies an action, at which more 
than one is present, though but one is active ; as, veikeve, to 
nurse — where the nurse only is active, and the child passive. 4. It 
also sometimes impli< s the habit or custom of doing a thing ; as, 
sa veimoku, or dauveimoku, ko ka. 5. It. very frequently changes 
verbs into nouns of action; as, era kitaka na veibulu, lit., they 
are doing the burial ; era kitaka na veivakamatei, they are doing 
{the work of) slaughter. 

N.B. 1. When used with words which prefix vaka, it precedes 
the vaka as in the last example. But when dau is used it precedes 
the vei, as m dauveivakamatei. 

N.B. 2. Whenever vei is prefixed to any class of verbs, those 
verbs always take their passive termination ; as, lomani, beloved; 
veilomani, not veilumana. Vei is sometimes reduplicated ; as, a 
mate veiveitauvi, a very infectious disease, or rather, a disease with 
which many are afflicted. 



VERBS. 43 

IV. COMPOUND VERBS. 

1. Yerbs compounded with other verbs. See page 4 of Preface 
toDietionary, the last paragraph. 2. Yerbs compounded of a noun 
and an adjective. The noun and adjective together are changed 
into a causative verb ; as, vakalomaqataka, to encourage, or cause 
to be of an inflt xible mind ; vakayagokaukauwataka, to cause to be 
strong in body ; yalovakatanitaka, to cause to be of a perverse 
mind ; vosavakacataka, to cause to be bad by representation ; 
vakayalocataka, to disaffect, lit. to cause one to be of a bad mind. 

V. REDUPLICATED FORMS OF THE VERB. 

1. It has already been seen (p. 30, etc.) that the active intran- 
sitive is generally a reduplicated, or partly-reduplicated form of 
the verb. But it must not be inferred that the reduplicated or 
partly-reduplicated forms are always active-intransitives ; for, 

2. Active-transitives are also frequently reduplicated, widen ap- 
pear generally to have a frequentative sense, and thus it seems 
to coincide with the sense of dau ; as, me kanikania is perhaps 
quite syn. with daukania. 

3. Reduplicated forms may have either a plural or frequenta- 
tive sense. As, sa uruuru mai na waqa is ustd only in a plural 
sense ; canoes are coming with sails down. Sa lutulutu naka, may 
either mean, that a thingfrequently falls, or that many things fall. 

We have mentioned in the Preface to the Dictionary that the 
simple form only, without the termination, is reduplicated; as, 
cakacakava, not cakavacakava. See also the reduplication of 
adjectives mentioned in the Preface, and for the reduplicated 
forms of the nouns, with their senses, see On the Derivation and 
Classes of Nouns. And for the reduplication of personal and 
possessive pronouns, see under the words Auau, and Nonanona. 
in the Dictionary. 

VI. REPETITION OF WORDS. 

As this form of speech seems nearly related to the redupli- 
cation of words, we will mention it here. 

The repetition of the same word, like the reduplicated form of 
a word, implies either frequency or intensity. And it appears to 
be used in the same manner in all languages, though much more 
in some than in others. In the Hebrew it is a well-known idiom, 
and of the most constant occurrence; as, Gen. iii. 7 : "I have 
seen, I have seen, the affliction of My people." In the Greek we 
have some remarkable instances of it ; as, Hebrews xm. 5 : " I 
will never leave thee nor forsake thee." In the Greek there are 
five negatives here, which render the passage much more empha- 
tical than it can be in Eoglish. But our own language is not 
destitute of similar repetition. Witness the following lines of 
J)r. Young : 



u 



FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 



"Then from the crystal battlements of heaven, 
Down, down, she hurls it through the dark profouod, 
Tea thousand thousand fathoms; there to rust, 
And ne'er unlock her resolution mere." 

Also in the national song when sung, we hear : 

" Britons never never never sha'l be slaves." 

And such phrases as, very very bad, are of every day occurrence. 
We do not therefore consider it a 'peculiarity of the Fijian lan- 
guage, only so far as it is used so much more frequently than in 
our own and other tongues. 

In Fijian we frequently hear, vinaka vinaka vinaka, good good 
good; sa lako lako lako, going g"ing going; sa vosa vosa vosa, 
talk talk talk ; i. e. always talking. They are sometimes run to 
an excessive length ; as. lako lako lako lako lak^, etc. The words 
capable of such repetitions are : 1. Adjectives ; as, vinaka. 2. 
Adverbs ; as vakalevu, vakalevu vakalevu, very greatly. 3. Verbs ; 
as, lako and vosa., 4. Interjections; as, isa i«a isa. The other 
parts of speech do not seem capable of such repetitions. 

VII. AUXILIARY VERBS. 

These are a very numerous and important class of words. The 
most important of them are, tiko, tu, Tcoto, no, toka, lako, voli, 
oti, and ro,wa. These are all used as primary as well as auxiliary 
verbs. Their meaning as primaries is, tiko, to sit; tu, toka, to 
stand; koto, to lie; no, to lie; lako, to go; voli, to go about, go 
here and there; oti, finished, done; rawa, accomplished, pos- 
sessed, able. These when used as auxiliaries answer two im- 
portant ends : 1. They generally determine the tense of a verb. 
2. They add to the principal verbs, of which they are auxiliaries, 
an aspect which is contained in their own senses as primitives. 

Exam/pies. 

Sa vua tu na kau, the tree is bearing fruit : more lit. the tree 
is fruiting (as if) stands. 

Sa moce koto na tamata, the man is sleeping; more lit. the 
man is sleeping (as he) lies; or the man lies sleeping. 

Sa bale no na uto, the bread fruit tree has fallen (and is) 

] J iri £-, 

Sa oula lako na gone, the child is alive (and) going (about). 

Sa tauvi mate voli na alewa, the woman is sick going about ; 
i. e. sick, but able to go about ; or is going about indisposed. 

Sa lokiloki voli na koli, the dog is lame going about ; i. e. is 
going about lame. 

Sa kalakala toka na vudi, the banana is leaning standing ; i. e. 
stands leaning. 

Au sa volavola tiko, I write sitting ; i. e. I am now writing, I 
sit writing. 



VERBS. 45 

Era sa will vola tu, they read standing ; i. e. they now stand 
reading. 

Sa caka oti, (it) is finished; more lit. (it) is made finished; i. e. 
is finished making, or the making of it is finished. 

Sa caka rawa is nearly syn. with sa caka oti, it means : (it) is 
made (or done) accomplished; i. e. the making or doing of it is 
accomplished. 

Oti, or rawa, when used thus, always implies that the verb is 
in the perfect tense; as it has been or is accomplished; it has 
been or is done. But the others generally express the present 
tense ; as, 

Sa cakava tiko ko koya, he is doing it now, or still. 

Sa vosa tiko ko ka, such an one is speaking. 

When the auxiliaries, tiko, tu, toka, koto, no, lako, voli, fullow 
verbs, the verbs may generally be rendered in English by the 
active participles, as in the preceding examples. But when rawa 
or oti follows a verb it may generally be rendered by the passive 
participle. When, however, rawa follows a def. trans, form of 
the verb, or a neuter- intrans. v., it must be rendered by can, or 
able; as, sa cakava rawa, (he) is able to do it; sa kauta rawa, (he) 
can carry it; sa qalo rawa, he can swim ; sa lako rawa na gone, 
the child is able to walk. 

There is no verb to be in Fijian, which appears a strange defect 
to a learner, who is perpetually needing in this respect what he 
can never find. This defect will be felt till he gets a good know- 
ledge of the language. The auxiliaries above are generally used 
instead; but no one of tbem can be used in all cases where our 
verb to be is. Tiko, to sit, and tu, to stand, approach the nearest 
in their use to our verb to be ; as, sa tiko na tamata daubutako, 
there are thieves ; sa tiko na tamata e kila, there are men who 
know; sa tu mai vale na yau, the property is in the house; sa 
tiko e na were na vuaka, the pig is in the garden. 

These auxiliaries frequently give a participial sense to the 
verbs they follow, as in most of the above examples ; and let it be 
observed once for all, that there is no distinct form of the verb to 
express a participial sense, but the sense of our participles is 
shown either by these auxiliaries or by the context. 



VIII. OF THE MOOD, TENSES, NUMBER, AND PERSONS 

OF VERBS. 

In respect to these the Fijian verb is very simple, even more 
so than the English, though that is more so than most others. 
There is a little change in the English verb to express different 
moods, tenses, numbers, and persons; but in Fijian there is none. 
Some of these differences are expressed in Fijian by particles 
which precede the verb ; as, e, sa, e sa, a, ka, na, ena, of tense ; 
and me and mo of mood. 



46 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 



Signs of Tense. 

1. Of the present tense. 

E and sa, and e sa, are signs of the present tense ; or more 
properly of the narrative tense ; and may be either past or 
present, but rarely future. Sa can be used after any of the other 
signs, as, e sa, ka sa, ena sa, na sa; but can only be used before 
na, as, sa na. 

They are generally used when a narrative is carried on after 
the sign of the past tense, or something else in the connexion has 
determined in what tense the speaker is speaking. The sign of 
the past tense, a, is rarely continued in a narrative. A, or some 
other worl, determines tlie tense, and then sa carries on the 
narative in that tense, whatever it may be. Sa and e may be 
generally interchanged when at the beginning of a sentence; as, 
e vinaka, or, sa vinaka ; e lako, sa lako ; but cannot always when 
it occurs in. the middle of a sentence ; as for instance, after the 
pronoun which is nominative to the verb, as, au sa lako, not au e 
lako; era sa cudru, not era e cudru; erau sa vala, not erau e 
vala. 

" Sa is the great verbal sign ; as, sa hama na koro, the town is 
burnt ; sa lako mai na waqa, the canoe has come ; sa bula na 
luvequ, my child is well." 

" Sa is also a common prefix to (or frequently used as a sign of 
tense before) words of other classes as well as verbs; but the 
distinction being plain it will not be easy to confound verbs with 
nouns, adjectives, or pronouns; for example — Sa turaga, he is a 
chief. Turaga denotes a person, and is therefore a noun. Sa 
dina, it is true. Dina denotes a quality, and is therefore an 
adjective. Sai koya, it is he. Koya is a pronoun." 

Sa and e become sai and ei when they precede words which 
require i to precede them ; as, sai valu ko Bau, Bau is at war. 
Both sa and sai may be used before a personal pronoun, but in 
different senses. Sai precedes the pronoun when the existence 
(or identity) of the person or thing represented by the pronoun 
is implied ; as, sai koya, it is he, that is it ; sai keda, it is we ; sai 
ira, it is they. But not when an action of the person or thing 
is expressed ; as, sa da lako, sa keitou vala, sa ra lako, not sai da 
lako, etc. 

2. Of the past tense. 

The signs of the past tense are a or ka, and we might add eliu, 
(formerly), rawa, and oti : the latter two of which have been 
treated of under Auxiliary verbs. 

A and ka, unlike e and sa, are rarely interchangeable. Perhaps 
ka is only used at the beginning of a sentence, and a in the 
middle. Ka, like e, is not used after the pronoun which is the 
nom. to the verb; as, au a lako; not au ka lako. 

3. Of the future tense. 

The signs of the future tense are na, ena, sa na, ena sa ; but it 



VERBS. 47 

is the na only that expresses futurity. Na alone, like a and sa, 
is used between the nom. case and the verb ; as, au na lako, not 
au ena lako, or au sa na lako. Eaa is used at the beginning of a 
sentence; as. ena lak ) ko koya, he will go ; or af'oer kevaka ; as, 
kevaka ena lako. 

Signs of the moods. 

These are only me and mo, to (or to the end that) or let ; vjhich 
are used before the imperative and infinite moods. Mo is used 
before the second person, as mo ko, mo dou ; and me before 
other persons. The pronoun ko is here frequently omitted ; as 
mo lako, f >r mo ko lako. Me becomes mei and mo moi before 
words which require i to precede them ; as, mei talatala ko koya ; 
moi talatala ko iko. Kevaka, if, and se, whether, may be called 
the sign of the subjunctive mood. But as there is no change 
in the verb itself, different moods of the verb are hardly worth 
mentioning. But though there is no difference in the form of 
the verb, Ih ire is a considerable difference in the forms of the 
pronouns when attached to different moods, which must well 
be observed in order to obtain correctness in speaking and writing. 

Mo is used before the second person in all numbers, and me 
before the rest. See more in Dictionary under Mo. 

We give the following as examples of the uses of the verbal 
signs of tense ; and of the different forms of pronouns used before 
the moods. 

INDICATIVE MOOD. 

Present tense. 

Singular. 

1st per. Au sa lako, I ^o, or am going. 
2nd per. Ko or o salako, you (thou) go, or are going. 
3rd per. Salako ko koya, he goes, oris going. 

Dual. 

1. incl. Edaru sa lako, we two go, or are going, 
excl. Keirau sa lako, we two go, or are going. 

2. Kemudran sa lako, you two go, or are going. 

3. Erau sa lako, they two go, or are going. 

Triad. < 

1 inclu.Eiatou sa lako, we three (or few) go, or are going. 

excl.Keitou sa lako, we three (or few) go, or are going. 

2 Kemudou sa lako, you three (or few) go, or are going. 

3 Eratou sa lako, they three (or few) go, or are going. 

Plural. 

1. incl. Eda sa lako, we go, or are going, 
excl. Keimami sa lako, we go, or are going. 

2. Kemnni sa lako, you go, or are going. 

3. Era sa lako, they go, or are going. 



48 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

Past tense. 

Substitute a for sa in all the above examples, and they will then 
be in the past tense. 

Future tense. 

Substitute na for sa in the above examples, and they will be in 
tbe future tense. The learner will find it more to his advantage 
to write out the above at full length in the past and future 
tenses than if they were printed in full here. 

IMPERATIVE MOOD. 

Singular. 

1. Me'ulako, let me go. 

2. Mo lako, mo ko lako, go you. 

3. Me lako ko koya, let him go. 

Dual. 

1. incl. Daru lako, or me daru lako, let us two go. 
excl. Me keirau lako, let us two go. 

2. Drau lako, or mo drau lako, go you too. 

3. Me rau lako, let them two go. 

Triad. 

1. incl. Tou lako, or medatou lako, let us three, or few, go. 
excl. Me keitou lako, let us three, or few, go. 

2. Dou lako, or mo dou lako, go you. 

3. Me ratou lako, let them go. 

Plural. 

1. incl. Da lako, or me da lako, let us go. 
excl. Me keimami lako, let us go. 

2. Mo ni lako, go you. 

3. Me ra lako, let them go. 

The particle mada is in very common use after verbs in the im- 
perative mood, though not after the imper. mood only : as, me'u 
lako mada ; mo lako mada ; tou lako mada ; me ra lako mada, etc. 
Mani is used in much the same way before the verb ; as, mani 
lako, go. 

SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD. 

This mood is indicated by the conjunction we, that, or to the end 
ihat. The signs and forms of the pronouns are the same in many 
instances as in the imperative mood; but, as they are not in all, 
we shall give this mood a distinct place. And to make it more 
definite shall place a verb before it, to show the relation of the 
indicative to the subjunctive mood. 

Let it be again observed, that the difference is in the signs 
and pronouns, and not in the verb. 

Singular. 

1. Sa kaya me'u lako, (he) says that I am to go. 

2. Sa kaya mo lako, (he) says that you are to go. 

3. Sa kaya me lako ko koya, (he) says that he is to go. 



VERBS. 49 

Dual. 

1 incl. Sa kaya me darn lako, (he) says that we two are to go. 
excl. Sa k*ya me keirau lako, (he) says thit we two are to go. 

2. S* kaya mo drau lako, (he) says that you two are to go. 

3. Sa kaya me rau loko, (he) says that they two are to go. 

Triad. 

1. inc 1 . Sa kaya me datou lako, (he) says that we are to go. 
excl. Sa k iya me keitou lako, (he) says that we are to go. 

2. Sa kaya Die kemudon lako, (he) says that you are to go. 

3. Sa kaya me ratou lako, (he) says that they are to go. 

Plural. 

1. incl. Sa kaya me da lako, (he) says that we are to go. 
exc). Sa kaya me keimami lako, (he) says that we are to go. 

2. Sa kaya mo ni lako, (he) says that ye are to go. 

3. Sa k*ya me ra lako, (he) says that they are to go. 

CONDITIONAL MOOD. 

It will be observed that a longer form of several pronouns is 
used alter kevaka, if, thin that in theimper. and subj. moods; 
as, kevaka eda, not kevaka da, which renders it necessary to con- 
sider the conditional mood separately. 

Singular, 

1. Kevaka ka'u sa lako, if I go. 

2. Kevaka ko sa lako, if you go. 

3. Kevaka sa lako ko koya, if he goe?. 

Dual. 

1. incl. Kevaka edaru sa lako, if we two go. 
exc 1 . Kevaka keirau sa lako, if we two go. 

2. Kevaka drau sa lako, if you two go. 

3. Kevaka erau sa lako, if they two go. 

Triad. 
1. incl. Kevaka edatou sa lako, if we three, or few, go. 
excl. Kevaka keitou sa lako, if we three, or few, go. 
9. Kevaka dou sa lako, ifyou three, or few, go. 
3. Kevaka eratou sa lako, if you three go. 

Plural. 

1. incl. Kevaka eda sa lako, if we go. 
exc). Kevaka keimami se lako, if we go. 

2. Kevaka kemuni, or ko ni sa lako, if ye go. 

3. Kevaka era sa lako, if they go. 

Here edaru, edatou, eda, erau, eratou, era, are used as well as 
when they begin a sentence, which is not the case in the imper. 
and subj. moods. 

4 



50 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

INFINITIVE MOOD. 

Me lako, to go. 

PARTICIPLES. 

They Lave the same form as the verb, except that sometimes an 
auxiliary verb is added to make it more definite ; a?, kemudou sa 
lako kivei ? where are yon going ? Keitou sa lako ki Rewa, we are 
going to Rewa. The same may be expressed in this way : kemu- 
dou sa lako tiko kivei ? acava na ka ko sa cakava, or a cava naka 
ko sa cakava tiko ? what are you doing, or what areyou now doing? 

VI ADVERBS. 

Adverbs qualify verbs, adjectives, or other adverb?. 

Adverbs are rarely simple words in any language; they are 
generally composed of two, three, or four words; and when the 
word?? of which an adverb is composed are written separately, it 
is called an adverbial phrase ; as, at least, by and by, iu like 
manner, &c. 

Grammarians consider the most common adverbial termina- 
tion — ly — to be an abbreviation of like ; as wisely, from wise-like. 
This is precisely the manner in which the Fijian adverbs are 
formed; by adding vaka, like, to an adjective; as, vuku, wise, 
vakavuku, wisely, or wise-like. 

There are various kinds of adverbs ; as, 

1. Adverbs of manner. These are generally formed by prefixing 
vaka to another word ; as, vakalevu, greatly ; vakabalavu, length- 
ily ; vakcica, badly; vakavioaka, well; vakaoqo, thus, in this 
manner; vakakina, in like manner, so. This is a very extensive 
class of adverb*. Wale, walega, uselessly, idly, freely, for nothing 
— and loa, accidently, undesignedly, at random, unthinkingly — 
are adverbs of manner. 

2. Adverbs of time. Edaidai, edaidaio qo, now, to-day ; ninaica, 
enaica ? when? vakasauri, immediately, instantly ; sara, after a 

. verb, immediately, at once; vakavica ? how many times ? e vica, 
how many ? vata, at the same time — is, sa yaco vata ; tale, again ; 
malua, by and by; tiko, tikoga, still, continually; ni, when; 
eliu, before, beforehand, formerly; qai, before a verb, now, just 
now, then, just then — as, sa qai lako, just gone; maimuri, emivn, 
hereafter, henc 'forth ; voleka, near, s >on ; vakavuqa, many times ; 
wasoina, frequently, often; o qo, now ; e na veisiga, daily ; e na 
veivula, monthly ; e na veiyabaki, yearly; vakavula, during the 
space of a month, monthly ; vakayabaki, during the space of a 
year, yearly ; e na siga, kei na siga, by day ; ena bogi, kei na bogi, 
by night; ena noa, yes>erday ; e na sabogibogi, or"mataka, in the 
morning, to-morrow ; kolai, k olak >lai, almost, nearly ; laki, lekai 
lau, almost, nearly; vakadua, once; vaktrua, twice; vtkatolu, 
three times. 

Adverbs of time implying frequency, habitualitr, etc., are 
frequently expressed by the prefix dau. {See Verbal Prefixes. 



PREPOSITIONS. 51 

3. Adverbs of place. Eke, ekeka, here ; kikea, kikeri, maikea, 
there ; o qo is also used for here ; evei ? where ? kike, hither ; 
kikea, thither; maikina, wherein, whereat, at which — as?, evei na 
vanua ko a tiko maikina; maicake, above; inaira, .era, below; 
kicake, upwards; kira, downwards; eloma, withia; vata, together, 
at one place ; etautuba, etaudaku, outside; esau, esaukani, outside; 
yan>, away, off; tani, to a different place, elsewhere — as, lako 
tani ; eruka ni. under; edela ni, above, up on ; e na tnata ni, before. 

4. Adverbs of affirmation. Io, yes ; ia, yes ; e dina, true, truly ; 
kj koya, that is it. 

5. Adverbs of negation. Sega ni, segai, no, not; tawa, not; e 
lasa, false, not so ; e tabu, it is unlawful; e dredre, difficult, im- 
possible, it cannot be so. 

Sega, sega ni, t iwa. There is an important difference in the 
use of these negatives. Sega implies the non-existence of a thing ; 
eega ni, and t iwa, the non-existence of a quality. 

Examples. 

Sa sega nai sele, there is not a knife ; 

Sa sega ni sele, (it) t's not a Jcnife ; 

Sa sega na tamata, there is not a mia ; 

Sa sega ni tamata, (he) is not a man ; 

Sa sega na vioaka, there is no goodness ; 

Sa sega ni vinaka, (it) is not good. 
Tawa may always be substituted for sega ni, but never can for 
sega, as in the above examples. For the reason of the use of ni 
after pet?a, see under Sega in the Dictionary. 

6. Adverbs of doubt. Beka, perhaps ; bagi, perhaps. 

7. Adverbs of cause. E na vuka ni, or, e na, because of, by 
means of, for tne sake of; ai cavai, mei cavai ? for what, why r* 

VII. PREPOSITIONS. 

The Fijian language appears to be more defective in words 
belonging to this part of speech than in any other. There are 
properly but three, e (or i), in ; ki, to ; mai, from. But the fact 
is, the Fijian dots not need many prepositions, for, as we have 
already seen, the verbal terminations answer to any prepositions 
which maybe needed. See Remark 1, on Intransitive Vvrbs, p. 31. 

1. E (in most dialects i), in. It is also used before the instru- 
ments by which a thing is performed, like with in English : sa 
volai e na peni kau, it is written with a pencil ; sa taya e na 
matau, (he) cut it with an axe. 

Bat vei is rarely used in this way before the agent of an action ; 
such forms as — sa volai vei Joni, written by John : sa ta vei 
Jemesa, cut by James — are by no means common. E na mata ni, 
before, in the presence of. 

2. Ki, to. This becomes vei, or hivei, before a personal pronoun, 
or proper name of a person ; as, kivei koya, to him ; kivei Tniki- 
lakila, to Tuikilakila. In many dialects kini is used instead of 

4-2 



52 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

kivei or vei. But vei is also used in the sense of from ; as, au a 
kauta tani vei koya, J took it away from him ; era sa lako tani 
vei au, they are gone away from me. 

But vua, to him, is more correct and definite than ki where it 
can be used ; as, au a masu vua na Kalou, is preferable to au a 
masu ki na Kalou. 

Yei, followed by a pronoun, is frequently used for to have, or 
possess. There is no verb to have in Frjian; e. g. sa tu vei au, 
(it) is with me — i. e. I have (it) ; satu vei iko, it is with you — i. e. 
you have it ; sa tu veiira, it is with them — i. e. they have it. The 
conjunction kei is frequently used as a preposition in this sense ; 
as, sa tiko kei au. 

Ki is sometimes used for at, when the name of a place follows ; 
as. sa tiko ki Bau, (he) lives at Bau. 

Kivakaki, lit. (to as to) towards. 

" Ki is sometimes used preposition ally before verbs; as, for 
example, lako ki moce, go and (to) sleep ; lako ki kaba niu, go 
and (to) climb nuts ; laki (or la'ki) is the contracted (and more 
common) form of lako ki." 

3. Mai, from; before the name of a place it frequently means 
at ; as, sa tiko mai Vewa, (he) lives at Vewa. 

The difference between mai and e, when used before the names 
of places, is, that when the person is in the place spoken of, e is 
used ; when elsewhere, mai is used ; as, if a person were living at 
Viwp, he would say, sa tiko e Yiwa ko Namosimalua; but if 
elsewhere, he would say, sa tiko mai Yiwa ko Namosimalua. 

Maivei is sometimes used before the personal pronoun, as mai 
is before common nouns ; as maivei koya. 

For other prepositional senses, see the terminations of verbs ; 
and for the sense of mai as opposed to yani, see the Dictionary 
under Mai. 

VIII. CONJUNCTIONS. 

There are but very few conjunctions in Fijian. Ka, kai, kei, 
and. These are but different forms of the same conjunction, but 
their different uses require to be noticed. 

Ka is used to connect verbs, or adjectives and adverbs ; as, era 
sa yavita ka (not kei) vakamatea, they smote him and killed him; 
pa vinaka ka dodonu, good and right : sa vosa vakadodonu ka 
kaukauwa, (he) speaks rightly and powerfully. 

Kei connects nouns and pronouns; as, a koli kei na vuaka, a 
dog and a pig; ko Tuinayau kei Waqaimalani; koi au kei koya 
taiega. Observe the article ko is omnted before the proper name 
after kei, though the article na is used before the common noun 
after it. 

Kai is only used instead of ka when a noun which requires i 
beiore immediately follows without an intervening article ; as, a 
turaga kai vakabula. Ka is frequently necessary in Fijian, 
where we cannot use and in English ; and is therefore frequently 
untranslatable. 



INTERJECTIONS. 53 

Se, or, whether. Se is frequently repeated in a sentence ; as, se 
lako se sega, whether (he) is gone or not. 

Ke, kevaka, if. When ke is used it must be repeated, like se ; 
as, ke sa lako ko na Vunivalu, ke sa sega ni yaga : lit. if the Vuni- 
Tttiu went, if no use. But when kevaka is used it need not be 
repeated. 

De, lest, perhaps. De becomes do before the pronouns ko and 
dou. 

Ga, only. This word is in very frequent requisition, and is 
often untranslatable. As there is no conjunction which answers 
to but, — ga, only, is frequently used instead ; as, au na sega ni 
mate, au na bula ga, I shall not die but live — lit. I shall not die, 
I shall live only. 

la ka may generally be used for but at the beginning of a 
sentence. 

la, yes, is very generally used merely as a conjunctive con 
junction. 

Ni, for, because, as, since. 

O koya, kina, a koya o q^, therefore; ap, koya sa lako kina ; 
or, koya o qo sa lako kina. 

IX. INTERJECTIONS. 

Interjections are very numerous in Fijian ; some of the more 
common are, drasadrasa, veTcivelca, velauela, isaisa, ule, of dis- 
approbation; sobosobo, ai valu, of surprise; ueue, vinahavinakx, 
cagia vuna, of approbation. 

ON EXPLETIVES, OR ORNAMENTAL PARTICLES. 

' Ai ukuuku ni vosa," — the ornaments of speech, as they ar^ 
sometimes called by the natives— is a very appropriate term. These 
are not necessary to the correctness or precision of a language, 
and yet some of them are not altogether destitute of meaning, or 
of utility; for they sometimes render rugged things much smoother, 
and give a slightly different aspect to a sentence from what it 
would have without them ; so that, although they are non-essentials 
in the language, we do not see any need to discard them altogether, 
either in writing or speaking. Some natives go to an absurd 
length in the use of them, and are not to be imitated ; others use 
them comparatively seldom. We would advise the learner not 
to use them at all till he has a good knowledge of the language ; 
for it is ridiculous to use non-essential words before he knows how 
to use essential ones. Bat a knowledge of these non essential 
words is highly important to the understanding of a native speech; 
when he knows them he can reject them from his mind as he 
hears them, and seize on words ot importance. But ivith id a 
knowledge of these words, on hearing them, they would be re- 
garded as important as others. 



54 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

We shall consider them in two classes. 

INSEPARABLE EXPLETIVES. 

These are -a, -ya, -ia, -rl, which are inseparable affixes to verbs, 
nouns, or adjectives. They are more commonly used at the 
end of a sentence, but not so exclusively. Unimportant as they 
are, they are enclitic particles, and always remove the accent to 
the syllable which precedes them ; as koro, korori; vale, valeri; 
lewa, lewaya. We have been disposed to think that words which 
end in a generally take the expletive ya ; those which end in e 
take a ; those which end in u take ia ; and that ri may follow any 
vowel. 

SEPARABLE EXPLETIVES. 

These are such words as mani, baki, bau, rui, gona, lia, ko, ko 
la, ko lana, mada, so, soti, tei, etc. 

We fully agree with Mr. Lyth, who observes — " Though I rank 
these as expletives, yet I doubt not but to a Fijian they are ex- 
pressive particles. The particles ri, ya, and a, are I think often 
used demonstratively, for this and that, here and there, as in the 
words, o qori, ko ya, andkea." 

The following passages written by a native may be sufficient to 
satisfy or satiate any one on the subject of expletives. 

What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and 
taketh away the reproach from Israel ? for who is this uncircum- 
cised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? 
1 Sam. xvii. 26. 

Translation : A cava na ka sa na caka vua na tamata sa na 
mokuta na kai Filisitia o qo, ka kauta tani nai rogorogo ca vei 
ira na Isireli P ni sa tamata maivei ko koya na kai Filisitia tawa 
cili o qo, me bolea a nona veimataivalu na Kalou bula ? 

Proposed amendment of a native : A cava dina sara mada go- 
na na ka ena caka ni na mini mokuti la na kai Filisitia ko lana, 
ka vueta na nodra totoka na Isireli ? e tamata ri maivei ko la na 
kai Filisitia tawa tiko e bure o qo me rui mai bolea soli kina va- 
kaoqo na nona matai valu na Kalou bula ? 

O cei koi an ? ka cava na noqu bula, se na mataqali itamaqu 
e Isireli, me'u sa vugona na tui ? Ia e na gauna me musu kina vei 
Tavita. 1 Samueli xviii. 18, 19. 

Native alteration : O cei gona koi au ? se sa rui cava talei soti 
gona na noqu bula, se na yavusa nei tamaqu vei Isireli, me'u rui 
mai vugona soti kina vakaoqo na turaga ? Ia e na gauna sa matata 
kina me musu vei Tavita. Here, among much that is useles?, 
there are some valuable alterations. 

There are some, to whose views we pay the greatest deference, 
who think that a different arrangement would be better; and that 
particles — as they make a most important part of, and are indeed 
a key to, the language — ought to occupy the first place in a 
Fijian Grammar. We have preferred following the usual arrange-

SYNTAX. 

We have rather largely anticipated this part of our subject, 
having frequently shown the uses of words, as well as their inflec- 
tion, in Etymology. 



56 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

"Syntax consists of three partp, concord, government, and the 
proper arrangement of words in a sentence." 

CONCORD. 

" Concord is the agreement which one word has to another in 
gender, number, case, or person." 
We may consider five concords in Fijian. 

1. Between a substantive and its adjectives. When adjectives 
admit of a singular and plural form, they must agree in number 
with their substantive ; as e dua na tamata lailai — not lalai : e rua 
na tamata lalai — not lailai ; e so na koro lelevu, not levu. 

2. Between a pronoun and its noun* ; as, eraua lako na tamata e 
lewe rua — not era or eratou : eratou a cakava na tamata e lewe 
tolu — not erau, or era. 

3. Between a relative and its antecedents ; as, a tamata e le tini, 
Jco ira ka lako ki Bau, those ten men who went to Bau — not ko 
koya, or koi rau. 

4. Between prepositions , and nouns, and pronouns, according to pre- 
ceding rules ; ap, dou vosa vei, or kivei, ira — not ki ira : era sa soko 
ki Ovalau — not vei Ovalau. 

5. Be 1 ween the possessive signs and nouns ard pronouns; as, ai 
wau i Koroicokanauto — not ni ; a lewa ni Bau — not i. 

GOVERNMENT. 

1. Transitive verbs govern n^uns and pronouns in the objective 
case ; a?, au sa lomani koya— not ko koya : era sa cudruvi Mai a — 
not ko Mara. 

2. Prepositions govern objective cases in the same manner. 

PROPER ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS IN A SENTENCE. 

1. On the position of the nominative as to its verb. 

(].) In. common, and proper nouns the nominative case folloivs 
the verb : as, sa lako mai ko Tuikilakila, Tuikilakila has come : sa 
kasa na waq?, the canoe is aground : sa cudru na kalon, the god is 
angry. 

(2.) But when the verb is active-transitive the nom. will fdlow 
the verb mediately, the objective case intervening ; as, sa cakiva 
na tamata na Kalou, made man God ; not sa cakava naKalou na 
tamata; sa vakabula na tamata ko Jisu,not savakabula ko Jisu na 
tamata. 

(3.) But in personal pronouns the nominative precedes the verb ; 
as, era sa vala tiko, they are fighting : e rau sa veilomani, they 
(two) love one another ; o sa dautiko maivei ? where do you live ? 

Nominative cases can precede the verb, but they are then 
nominative-absolute ; as, ko Tuikilakila, sa lako mai, (as for) 
Tuikilakila, he has come; na waqj, sa kasa; na kalou, sa cudru. 
Sj personal pronouns can follow their ve/bs, but the phrase is then 
generally clumsy, or disrespectful ; as, sa cudru ko iko ; sa dautiko 
maivei ko iko ? seems disrespectiul : sa veilomani koi rau ; sa 
veivala tiko ko ira, is clumsy. 



PROSODY. 57 

2. The pcsUicn (f the ohjective case. 

The objective case immediately follows the verb ; a?, era kana 
tamata, they eat men. When the indef. trans, form of the verb is 
used, the article does not precede the objective case, as in the 
above example ; but when the def. trans, form is used, it does; 
as, era kania na tamata. The article if, however, frequently 
oruitted before possessive pronouns which commerce with n y 
as, era kitaka nodra ka. This is probably to avoid the repeti- 
tion of n. But the article ko is always omitted before proper 
names, -when they follow the verbs as objective cases; as, sa 
lomani Lasarusa ko Jisu. 

Bat the objective case may precede the verb as an " absolute 
case ;" as, a ka o qo au sa cakava ; fur, au sa cakava na ka o qo ; 
ko Tomasa sa lomana ko Jemesa. 

3. On 1 he position of the adjective with its r>oim. 

(1.) When an adjective is joined as an epithet to a noun, it imme- 
diately fellows the noun ; as, a tamata vinaka, a good man ; a koli 
kata, a savage dog ; a toa uro, a fat fowl. 

(2.) But when an adjective is the predicate of a proposition, it 
precedes the noun ; a3, sa vinaka na tamata o qo, this man is good ; 
sa ca na ka o qori, this thing is bad ; sa vuca na kau ko ya, that 
tree is rotten. 

4. On the position of the pronouns. 

We have already spoken of the position of the personal pro- 
nouns. 

(1.) Demonstrative pronouns follow the nouns to which they 
relate ; a«, a tamata o qo, man this ; a gone ko ya, child that. 

(2.) Possessive pronouns precede their nouns, as in English, 
except in the cases mentioned under classes of nouns (p. 8) ; as, 
a noqu vale, my house ; anomui sele, thy knife ; a nona were, his 
garden. 

(3.) Interrogative prone uns are used before nouns, as in the 
English; as, o cei na tamata ko ya; who is that man? a cava 
na ka ko sa kaya ? what do you say ? lit. what is the thing you say ? 

5. Adverbs follow the verbs or adjectives to which they relate ; 
as, sa ca vakalevu, bad very; sa lako vakusakusa, goes swiftly. 

PROSODY. 

" Prosody teaches the proper pronunciation of words, and the 
laws of verse." 

Under Pronunciation, Accent, Quantity, Emphasis and Tone 
are considered. 

1. Accent. The Fjian accentuation is very easily obtained. 
The accent is invariably on the last syllable, or last bat one. 

2. Hence, when a verb affixes a definite-transitive termination, 
or a noun a pronominal postfix, it removes its accent from the 
sellable it was on when a simple word. If the affixed termination 
consists of one syllable, the accent will be removed one syllable; 
if of two, it will be removed two syllables nearer the end of the 
word; as, kaba, kalata, kabataka ; yago, yagoqu; uiu, uludra, 



58 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

The same holds good when expletive terminations are added ; as 
vale, valeri; koro, korori. 

3. When a word is entirely reduplicated, it takes two accents ; 
as, vala, valavala. When it is but partly reduplicated, the accent 
remains as in the simple word; as, leka, leleka; Joma, loioina. 
But if the word has three syllables, and two of them reduplicated, 
the first syllable will have a secondary accent; as in cakacakava. 

4. When a verb does not affix au additional syllable on becom- 
ing a definite-transitive, it removes i*s accent to the last syllable, 
imiess it was there before; as, vola, indef. tr., vola, def. tr. ; tara, 
idef. tr., tara, def. tr. 

5. Oa account of the prevailing tendency of the language to a 
penultimate accent, and of our own to an ante-penultimate, the 
natives generally accent introduced names or words of more than 
t>ro syllables differently from us. See Preface to Dictionary. 

The Quantity of a syllable is the time occupied in pronounc- 
ing it. 

Quantity differs from accent, as a syllable may be long without 
being emphatic. Quantity is an important subject in Fvjian, as 
a different quantity not unfrequently alters the sense of a word. 
The quantity of a syllable, as pronounced by a native, must be 
well attended to by those who would speak properly. 

Emphasis is the same to a sentence as accent is to a word. As 
it is the sense which determines the emphasis, the rules for 
placing the emphasis must be svsbstantially the same in all 
languages. Studiously avoid placing the emphasis on articles, 
prepositions, conjunctions, expletives, and all words of minor 
importance. The natives frequently emphasize very strongly and 
very correctly. Nature will teach this when followed. 

Tones. The meaning of words and sentences, and the proper 
placing of accents, may be learned from books : but the proper 
tones of a language can never be learned except from hearing 
and imii-ating good native speakers. 

Euphony also has lent her aid to facilitate the rapidity and 
casein speaking Fijian. Yowels belonging to different words are 
sometimes changed, and coalesce into a diphthong; as, yavai rua, 
for yava e rua, javai va, for yava e va, domoi levu, for domo e 
1 vu, tama i keitou is pronounced tamai keitou. In prepositions 
and verbs ending in ei before a personal pronoun beginning with 
i, the first i is elided, as vei iko, vukei ira, vak tmatei iratou, are 
commonly pronounced ve' iko, vuke' ira, vakamate' iratou. This 
appears a more correct way of writing tbem than vei ko. When 
two syJlables of the same sound come together, the latter of them 
is sometimes elided, or assimilated into the preceding one, as, va 
for vaka before words beginning with ka, or qa. 

POETRY. 
A poem is called a meke ; but a ineke means also to sing and 



POETRY. 50 

dance. Its primitive and proper signification, most probably, is 
to more about, or dance, as that of yam ek em eke is still. 

Tnere is an abundance of poetry in the language on many 
subjects. The natives are passionately fond of it, and are in- 
cessantly at a humdrum kind of chant. They also frequently 
assemble and meke for whole Lights together, and can, when 
they try, chant very agreeably. But as they have nothing while 
in tbeir heathen state that bears any resemblance to our mode of 
tinging, it will be a long time before they will appear to advan- 
tage in this refined art j if indeed their voices will ever be capable 
cf if. at all. 

Most of their poetry is in blank verse ; but they have some — 
especially epigrammatic couplets — in rhyme; and they have 
quite a taste — or rather passion — for poetry of this kind. 

O iko ko tagi, 
Oi au ka'u caki. 

Noqui tau, 
Solia noqu yau. 

A turaga o qo e dauvuvu, 
Mai baria na vatu ka tu. 

O iko ko dredre, 
Oi au ka'u nene. 

E dua nomu waqa levu, 
E dua nomu vusi levu. 

A taro na kila ka, 
A bora na ka ca. 

As to measure some lines are very irregular, but others are 
perfectly regular. Some lines consist of pure iambic, others of 
trochaic, others of iambic and dactylic feet. But perhaps the 
most consist of iambics with an odd syllable. As — 

Pure Iambics. 

Ai\ va | ka'o | vole | a wa | lega. 

Iambic with an odd syllable. 

e du | a no | mu. wa | qa le | vu. 
e du J a no | mu vu | si le | vu.. 

Pure Trochaic. 

Bu!u. | vata | nona | gaca | gaca. 

Trochaic with an odd syllable. 

Ma na | cove | cove | e la | kovi j mai ko J tacu — 6. 

Mixed feet. 

Au I viii vo.a I vakama I raiua. 



60 FIJIAN GRAMMAR. 

Tiiku | tuku e | rogo ma | lua, 

Rogo ki | Yiwa | caca va | ka bu. | ka. 

a vopo | *a na ma | te, 

a did | na ka | ni vei wa | li. 

Almost all our sacred poetry in Eaglish, as, long, common, and 
short measures, 6-8's, etc., consists of pure iambics. But as 
there are so few words in Fijian which accent the last syllable, 
and so few monosyllabic words, compared with those in the 
English, we believe it impossible to make any considerable 
number of lines together in that measure, and therefore im- 
possible to write a good poem in the same measure as that in 
which the great mass of our English poetry is written. Oar 
native hymns are perhaps as good as the language will admic 
of, and do great credit to their authors. But there is not a hymn 
in the book, and but very few verses, where iambics are required, 
in which the feet are regular throughout. Many of the lines 
which should consist of iambic feet only, consist of trochaic 
only. Take the first line in the book : 

Me u | dolu | na ya | me da : 
which should be 

Me u | dolu. | ra ya | me da : 

To be read thus would be intolerable. 

Again, the last line in the first verse : 

Kei na | nodai | Yaka | bill a. 

The best hymn in the book as to measure, and the only one 
that is regular throughout, is the one which required trochaic 
feet j viz. the twentieth. And even in this two of the lines which 
required iambic feet are irregular, having a trochaic foot at the 
end of the line, unless we mis-accent the words; viz. — 

E na vu ni yaloqu, 
and E ruku nitabamu. 
From the above it appears that the Fijian is much better 
suited to the trochaic than the iambic measure, in which most 
of our sacred poetry is written; and it is desirable to have more 
of the hymns in the trochaic, or the measure of the twentieth 
hymn. 

Miscellaneous Idioms, dc. 

1. The passive voice is frequently used in Fijian where we 
should use the active in English ; and on the contrary we 
frequently use the passive in Eaglish in cases in which it is never, 
or very rarely, used in native. Mr. Hunt says — Sometimes the 
p issive form is used in the imperative mood when a command is 
given without any person being named to perform it, which may 
be called an indefinite-imperative ; as, me tataviraki na vale, let 
the house be swept ; for, dou tataviraki na vale, sweep the house. 

2. On the other hand the passive verbs are generally followed 



IDIOMS. 61 

by the agent by whom the action is performed in English, but 
rarely in native ; as, 

John is smitten by William. 

He is beloved of God. 

Peter is reproved by Paul. 

In all such cases we must use the active voice ; as, 

Sa yaviti Joni ko Wiliami, William strikes John. 

Sa lomam koya na Kalou, God loves him. 

Sa vunauci Petero ko Paula, Paul reproves Petero. 

If we omit namirg the agents, we can then use the passive 
forms ; as, 

Sa yaviti ko Joni, 

Sa lomani ko koya, 

Sa vunauci ko Petero. 

" Si sneu e na Kalou" I think unintelligible. 

3. The possessive case is frequently used in English and 
Greek to express what is called the genitive of the object ; as, 
the love of God frequently means love to God. In such cases 
we must not use a loloma ni Kalou, but as it is rightly rendered 
in 1 John iii. 17, na loloma vua na Kalou. 

4. In English we say far from ; but in Fijian the preposition 
Tci, to, must be used after yawa, far, and not mai; as, sa yawa 
ki Bau ko Somosomo ; not, sa yawa mai Bau. 

Also after yani, away ; tani, elsewhere ; yali, lost, absent ; 
we must not use mai, from, as in English, but e. in ; as, sa 
yali eke ; sa tiko tani eke ; sa lako yani eke ; not maike. Except 
when the place spoken of it is at a distance ; then mai (as being 
the same as e when the place is present. See prepositions, p. 
51,) will be used; as, sa yali mai Bau; sa lako tani miiBau. 
Ki, to, not mai, from, is used after vuni, hidden. 

5. Both articles o and na are used before many appellations ; 
as, o or ko na Kauvadra; "before the proper names of houses 
and canoes; as, o na Mataiweilagi, (the name of Thakombau's 
house,) o na Uluilakeba (the name of a canoe)." 

The article o or ko and the preposition mai, from, are used 
before names of towns or districts, as an appellative of the 
chief; as, o mai Viwa, he from Yiwa, i. e. the chief of Yiwa. 
And, o mai na is used as an appellative of the owner of the 
house; as o mai na Mataiweilagi, he from the house so named — 
viz. Thakombau. Or a person may take his name from some 
other circumstance ; as, ko mai Toga, he from Tonga, or he that 
has been at Tonga.

The work assigned to each is exceedingly natural. The i 
is retained before tutu, (covi itutu,) contrary to our practice, 
because it was so written by the native, and because it is heard ; 
and therefore perhaps ought to be written before all words 
which are preceded by the article ai. 

A HEATHEN PRATER. 

(Written by a Native.) 

The following is a specimen of the prayers of heathen priests 
when things are taken to the bures to be offered to the gods. 
It will show the general forms of address to the gods, and affords 
abundance of examples of elliptical modes of expression, and 
of the profusion in which they use expletives. It contains the 
substance of what they generally pray for ; viz. that the season 
may be fruitful ; that the blossoms may be fruit- bearing blossoms 
(not false blossoms) ; and that they may have plenty of fish. 
Many gods (indicated by the many bures mentioned) with their 
children, and dead men are invoked. The gods are entreated 
to be of one mind (veivau) to let us live, and the children and 
women, and to sweep away all diseases, and that we may be far 
from every calamity ; and that we may be at peace with Bau ; 
and that our enemies may be clubbed, etc. 

The bures, gods, and human personages apply almost ex- 
clusively to Yewa.

Those who can read and understand the above without note 
or comment, it may be presumed, can understand anything; 
though it appears to be in thorough native style on such occa- 
sions, and therefore very useful to be known. I have sup- 
plied some of the words omitted by ellipsis, and the following 
notes will help to clear the rest. But the words in parenthesis 
must be omitted to see the proper native niude of sjpeaking in 
prayer. 

a. Tokara, is the opposite of sewaruta, or false-blossoms. 

b. Burelevu. the bure of ko Maivuniveei. 

c. The uluruatua (fhbt-born) of ko Maivunivesi. 

d. All the children of ko Maivuniveei are called, " na vu ni moli." Ko 

Maivunivesi, his first-born, and all bis (dead) children are here invoked. 
Natoudua, the name of a bure iu which ko Maivuuivesi is buried. 

e. '* Na ulu 1 tou ; " dou kila saka mada, na ulu i tou, is the most common 

form of addressing the gods; and, me ra bula mada ga na noma liga 
ni yaqona, is one of the most common petitions, under a belief that the 
gods are very fond of yaqona. 

./. The similarity of this to '' Women in the tent," Jud. v. 21, is very striking. 

n . Milamila, is put for all kinds of diseases. 

a. The construction of this sentence is wtll worthy of notice.
