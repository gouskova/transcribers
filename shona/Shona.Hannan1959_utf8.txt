A


 a represents, in Shona, the sound that is heard in the first element of the diphthong in the English word high. It is a low central vowel and never combines with any other vowel to form a diphthong. In the printed sequences aa, ae, ai, ao, each vowel letter stands for the nucleus of a separate syllable. Within word stems, when a follows e, i, o and u, an intervocallic y or w seems to be required- the same addition seems to be required also in borrowed words, especially in proper names; e g Rusiya for Lucia. In interjections and ideophones a is often partially devoiced and pronounced with strong breath force, sometimes with staccato, sometimes with lengthening. Dictionary entries indicate only lengthening. This is done by inserting a hyphen; e gbha-a.

B


b represents two different sounds: 1. an implosive voiced bilabial, a sound that is not represented by any letter in an English word2. an explosive voiced labial that is pronounced in much the same way as the b in the English word bean.Implosive b occurs nearly always as a single consonant'and hardly ever in combination with another consonant. There are a few words in which the b in thc combination bw is implosive. Wherever the letter b appears as the only consonant in a Shona syllable it stands for the implosive b.Explosive b rarely occurs as a single consonant but is common in combination with m, v ;v and zv. On nearly every occasion that the ietter b occurs in a Shona syllable in combination with other consonants it represents explosive b. Explosive b, when it occurs as the only consonant in a syllable, is represented by bh.

D




d represents two different sounds: 1. the voiced alveolar implosive, a sound not represented by any letter or letters in an English word; and 2. the voiced dental explosive, a sound similar to the sound represented by d in the English word dear. Implosive d practically never occurs in combination with other consonants, but only as fhe single initial consonant of a syllable. The very few words in which the d in the combination dw, is implosive ar� marked with an asterisk. Whenever the letter d appears in a Shona word as the only consonant in association with a vowel it represents the implosive d.  Explosive d occurs in combination with the consonants n, z, zw and zv, as well as with w and y, and in such combinations it is represented by the letter d. When d is written in combination with another consonant in a Shona word it represents explosive d. On the relatively few occasions when explosive d occurs as the only consonant in association with a vowel it is represented by dh.

E



e represents the sound that is heard as the first element of the diphthong represented by ei in the English word Sreight. A midforward vowel, pronounced with medium lip-spread, e never combines with another vowel to form a dipthong. In such sequences as ee, ei, eo, eu each vowel-letter stands for the nucleus of a separate syllable. Within stems, the sequence ea seems to require an intervocalic w or y to separate the syllables. ln interjections and in ideophones, e may occur with short staccato or with considerable lengthening (indicated by the addition of a hyphen: e-e, or even e-e-e). The dictionary does not include entries for variants heard when some speakers add a nonphonemic y before e; e g ktlyenda.

I



i represents the sound that is represented by the ea in the English word leaves. A highforward vowel, pronounced with lip-spread, i never combines with another vowel to form a diphthong. In such sequences as ii, iu, ai, oi, each vowel letter stands for the nucleus of a separate syllable. Within stems, an intervocallic y or w seems required in the sequences ia, ie and io. There are no entries in the dictionary for variants that occur when speakers double i (as in kudziidza), or insert a non-phonemic semi-vowel between i and i (as in chEyi), or between i and a preceding vowel (as in amayi), or between i and a following vowel (as in ndiyende). However, such words as kambiya and zviyo do require the y. In ideophones and interjections i occurs with short staccato at times, and at other times with lengthening; this being indicated by a hyphen as in i-i.
(i) KKoMZ: Nouns of class 9 have no expressed prefix [zero prefix]. The pl form of the noun is the same as the sg form. In M & Z prothetic i- appears before monosyllabic nouns of cl la, 5, 9 & 10, e g imbwa. When adjectives are brought into concordial agreement with nouns of classes 9 & 10, their initial sounds undergo the same changes, due to the latent prefix, as the initial sounds of the noun stems of cl 9- e g imbwa rnhenyu (from adj st -penyu).
Nouns of cl 9 are: 1. Names of animals,
birds and reptiles. 2. Names of various kinds of people. 3. The enclitic interrog n -i KKoZ, -nyi M. 4. Deverbative nouns with terminative -o indicating the instrument or result of verbal action. 5.
