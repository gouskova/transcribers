# transcribers
Some utilities for converting orthography into IPA or ASCII formats compatible with several phonological learner programs. 

The Russian branch implements phonological rules such as voicing assimilation and vowel reduction in unstressed syllables, and can distinguish up to three degrees of stress marking. Also does UCLA Phonotactic Learner transcription and Minimal Generalization Learner transcription of Russian.

The file "transcribe_zaliznyak.py" shows an example of how to use the transcriber on a tab-delimited file.

To do: add an interactive, user-friendly gui that will give the user some options for what the file looks like, what to name the columns, and so on.
